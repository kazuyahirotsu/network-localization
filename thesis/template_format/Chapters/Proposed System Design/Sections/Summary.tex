\section{Summary}

This chapter introduces the proposed system's design, including the proposed system's implementation scenario,  all included modules, and the system's workflow—from traffic collection to the traffic steering of detected anomalous devices. The chapter focuses on the anomaly detection scheme used in the system, which continuously collects traffic, segments it, and processes it in time-based batches for online learning training. This chapter also explains the system's scheme and highlights the MQTT features selected for the proposed system. These features are collected from U-Plane traffic at the application layer.
