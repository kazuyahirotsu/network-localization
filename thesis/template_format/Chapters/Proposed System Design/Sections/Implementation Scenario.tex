\section{Implementation Scenario}
The investigated scenario of the proposed method assumes the following:
Within a factory-owned local 5G-IIoT environment, sensor and controller devices (i.e., UEs) connect to a local 5G system, adopting MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol for data transmission. A machine learning processing node is also placed to host and provide necessary processing capability for the following parts: RIC for RAN management and a machine learning model for anomaly detection tasks. Examples of anomaly traffic include the generation of pressure sensor alarms and malicious inquiries. Machine learning is deployed in a centralized way since the low computing power and processing capability of IIoT devices cannot afford distributed learning computational burden.
The assumed anomaly traffic includes two types: out-of-bound false pressure readings emitted from the pressure sensors and simulated malicious inquiries from and towards false or unknown destinations.
