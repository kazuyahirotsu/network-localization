\section{Objectives}

The objectives of this thesis include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design a scheme to provide detailed U-Plane traffic data for the anomaly detection and congestion solution.
    \item Design an online machine learning-based unsupervised clustering algorithm to perform flexible anomaly detection with a low-cost training method that does not need a manually labeled dataset.
    \item Propose an autonomous scheme that utilizes the RIC to perform traffic steering for detected anomaly devices and redirect the devices to a reserved gNB to offload the congestion on the main network.
    \item Setup a testbed based on real-world local 5G network for the simulation of the proposed system, and evaluate the accuracy.
\end{itemize}
