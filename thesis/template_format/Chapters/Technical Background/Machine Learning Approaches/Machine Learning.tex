\chapter{Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection Approaches}

In the concept of RAN management for large-scale IIoT, machine learning-based approaches have become the trend for conventional methods due to the high traffic volume and the difficulties in analysis. The benefits of utilizing machine learning include cost efficiency and rapid response capability. This chapter will introduce machine learning-based RAN management approaches, focusing on anomaly detection and device classification tasks.
