\subsection{Summary}

In this chapter, we provide a brief introduction to the background and architecture of private local 5G systems. We then discuss the 5G Core Network (5GC), which is the heart of 5G systems, and highlighted one of its core features—the separation of the Control Plane and User Plane. We outline how these two planes can be leveraged for RAN (Radio Access Network) management, focusing on their respective parameters and KPIs. Following this, we provide an overview of the general architecture of the Radio Access Network and introduce the most critical component for RAN management—the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). We further explain the two types of applications running on the RIC: xAPPs and rAPPs, summarizing the potential optimizations that can be achieved through RIC-based RAN management based on findings from previous research.
