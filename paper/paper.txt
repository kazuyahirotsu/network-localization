Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)–Based Localization for Low‑Density LPWA Networks in GNSS‑Denied Environments

Abstract 

LPWA networks such as LoRa are often deployed for sensing, yet turning these deployments into localization infrastructure requires accurate anchor coordinates—a challenge in GNSS‑denied or degraded environments. We study self‑localization of static beacons in sparse outdoor graphs using only RSSI. We propose a physically informed, edge‑conditioned GCN that learns a trainable RSSI→distance module jointly with graph message passing while treating anchors as fixed. Edges carry short RSSI time series augmented with the learned distance estimate, enabling distance‑aware aggregation without assuming a hand‑tuned path‑loss model. We build a terrain‑aware Longley–Rice simulator and evaluate on N=200 held‑out graphs with 64 nodes (16 anchors) and 10 RSSI samples per directed link. In the terrain‑aware regime, the method attains a mean error of 206.74 m (median 182.42 m; p90 381.01 m), substantially outperforming a plain GCN without the physical module (750.87 m mean) and iterative multilateration (1974.40 m mean). Under idealized free‑space, multilateration achieves 6.28 m mean while our model reaches 51.15 m, demonstrating that terrain effects can reverse the apparent ranking of methods and underscoring the need for terrain‑aware evaluation. The approach requires only commodity radios and supports region‑specific pre‑deployment training from simulation followed by label‑free calibration using anchor–anchor RSSI. Results indicate a practical path to reliable outdoor localization when GNSS is unavailable.

1. Introduction

Low‑power wide‑area (LPWA) networks such as LoRa are primarily used to connect battery‑powered sensors for environmental monitoring, infrastructure sensing, and public safety. In these sensing applications, precise beacon coordinates are often unnecessary. However, when an LPWA deployment is repurposed as localization infrastructure, precise anchor locations become critical because downstream systems assume reliable anchor locations. In GNSS‑denied or degraded settings (e.g., urban canyons, canopy, indoors, interference), obtaining those coordinates is challenging yet essential to deliver dependable location services.

This paper focuses on self‑localization of static LoRa beacons from signals already available on commodity hardware. Concretely, we consider a 4 km × 4 km outdoor region with sparse connectivity and only received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. The network comprises 64 nodes with a 1:3 anchor ratio (16 anchors, 48 unknowns), and each directed link provides a practical budget of 10 RSSI samples. The goal is to infer absolute 2D positions for the unknown nodes using RSSI‑only observations under realistic LoRa operating conditions.

In this paper, we show that a physically informed, edge‑conditioned graph convolutional network (GCN) that learns a trainable path‑loss model from RSSI time series can recover accurate beacon locations in sparse LPWA graphs. First, we introduce an RSSI→distance module whose parameters are learned jointly with the GCN, producing distance‑aware, interpretable edge features. Second, we design an anchor‑aware message‑passing architecture (NNConv) that exploits unknown‑to‑unknown links while keeping anchors fixed to prevent drift. Third, we build a terrain‑aware (Longley–Rice) data‑generation pipeline and a controlled evaluation that demonstrates consistent gains over iterative multilateration and a plain GCN variant in realistic, low‑density outdoor topologies.

Relative to prior work, our approach brings explicit physical modeling into the GCN by learning path‑loss parameters end‑to‑end, leverages unknown‑to‑unknown connectivity that geometric solvers leave untapped, and evaluates under sparse outdoor conditions where fingerprinting (site surveys) and TDoA/ToA (GNSS‑disciplined synchronization) are less practical. This combination of physically grounded features, graph reasoning, and terrain‑aware evaluation targets the deployment realities of LPWA localization.

The remainder of the paper reviews related work, presents the proposed method, details the evaluation setup and baselines, reports results with quantitative and qualitative analyses, and concludes with practical guidance and limitations.

2.1 Localization Methods

Classical multilateration recovers node positions from pairwise distances via least‑squares or related solvers [2], [3]. Iterative variants temporarily promote newly localized unknown nodes as anchors to increase the number of anchors. In low‑density outdoor LoRa graphs with few anchors and limited line‑of‑sight, early inaccuracies in promoted nodes can propagate and compound across iterations [13].

Fingerprinting learns a mapping from observations (e.g., RSSI vectors) to coordinates using k‑NN or neural models. It can achieve high accuracy in confined or semi‑static environments but requires site surveys and tends to degrade under environmental shift [4], [7].

GNNs model the network explicitly as a graph so message passing can exploit unknown‑to‑unknown links. Prior work demonstrates benefits for localization, including high‑order GNNs [9], graph‑fusion designs [8], large‑scale settings [10], and WiFi RSSI localization [11]. Edge‑conditioned or edge‑aware message passing is a natural fit when rich edge attributes are available. However, explicit physical path‑loss modeling within GNNs and validations under low‑density outdoor LPWA topologies remain limited.


2.2 Communication Data

Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measures how strong a signal is at the receiver. It is widely available on commodity LPWA radios and can be collected with low‑cost hardware, so it underpins many multilateration and learning‑based methods. Despite its ubiquity, RSSI is noisy and exhibits high variance. Mapping RSSI to distance depends on terrain and clutter, and mis‑specified path loss introduces bias and large errors [2].

Time‑based localization avoids explicit path‑loss modeling, but it depends on tightly synchronized clocks (typically GNSS‑based) and multiple gateways with favorable geometry. In GNSS‑denied settings, achieving such synchronization is impractical or costly to replicate (e.g., via wired or network time), which limits feasibility [5].

Channel state information (CSI) offers higher‑resolution signal descriptors and is widely used indoors [8]. Such specialized hardware is uncommon in low‑cost outdoor LPWA deployments.

Given these constraints, we focus on RSSI‑only sensing and mitigate path‑loss uncertainty by learning a physically interpretable RSSI→distance module within the model.

2.3 Relation to Our Previous Work

Our 2024 IEEE Access paper focused on drone localization and treated beacon positions as known or externally provided [1]. Here, we instead address self‑localization of the beacons themselves using pairwise RSSI only.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Proposed Method

Figure \ref{fig:architecture_01} provides an overview of the model and data flow.

3.1 Problem Formulation

We model the beacon network as a directed graph G=(V,E) with anchors A and unknown nodes U, |V|=64 and |A|=16. Each node i has an absolute position p_i∈R^2; p_i is known for i∈A and unknown for i∈U. For each directed edge (i,j)∈E we observe K RSSI samples r_ij^(k), k=1..K (K=10).

We adopt a log‑distance path‑loss model with an additive offset and noise.
r_ij^(k) = P_t − 10 n log10(d_ij) + o + ε_ij^(k),  where d_ij = ||p_i − p_j||_2.
Here P_t (dBm) is an effective transmit power term, n is the path-loss exponent, o (dB) is an offset absorbing hardware/terrain biases, and ε_ij^(k) models measurement noise and small-scale effects. Given the sample mean r̄_ij, we form a per-edge distance estimate
d̂_ij = 10^((P_t + o − r̄_ij)/(10 n)). In our implementation, P_t is fixed at 13 dBm while n and o are learned. For numerical stability we clamp the denominator 10n away from zero, bound the exponent to [−2, 5], and lower‑bound distances by a small ε>0.

Node features are x_i^0 = [x_i, y_i, is_anchor]. For anchors, (x_i,y_i) are the known coordinates. For unknowns, we initialize (x_i,y_i) near the anchor centroid. Edge attributes concatenate the RSSI time series with the distance estimate. We define e_ij = [r_ij^(1..K), d̂_ij]. The task is to predict absolute positions p̂_i for i∈U given (G, {x_i^0}, {e_ij}).

3.2 Physically‑Informed Edge‑Conditioned GCN

We use edge‑conditioned convolutions (NNConv) where a small MLP EdgeNet maps edge attributes e_ij to a per‑edge weight matrix. A layer computes
x_i^{(ℓ+1)} = σ( mean_{j∈N(i)} W_{ij}^{(ℓ)} x_j^{(ℓ)} ),
with mean aggregation and ReLU nonlinearity σ. The first NNConv maps D_0=3 to H=64 using EdgeNet_1 that outputs D_0·H=192 parameters per edge. The second NNConv maps H→H with EdgeNet_2 outputting H·H=4096 parameters. A final linear head maps H→2 to produce coordinates. This matches our implementation in PyTorch Geometric (NNConv, aggr="mean").

For each edge (i,j), we construct e_ij by concatenating the K=10 RSSI samples with the learned distance estimate d̂_ij, so e_ij∈R^{K+1}=R^{11}. EdgeNet is a 2‑layer MLP (64 hidden units, ReLU) that outputs the required per‑edge kernel size for each NNConv layer.

We standardize node features (including the is_anchor flag) and target coordinates with zero‑mean, unit‑variance scalers fit on the training split. Predictions are inverse‑transformed before evaluation. Anchors’ predictions are overwritten by their known coordinates.


FIG: images/model_architecture.png | Architecture of the proposed edge‑conditioned GCN. | fig:architecture_01

3.3 Trainable Path‑Loss Module (RSSI→Distance)

We learn global path‑loss parameters (n, o) as trainable scalars and hold P_t fixed at 13 dBm. Given r̄_ij, the module outputs d̂_ij as in Section 3.1. For stability, when |n| is close to zero we add a small ε to the denominator 10n; the exponent (P_t + o − r̄_ij)/(10n) is clamped to [−2, 5]; and d̂_ij is lower‑bounded by ε meters. These bounds imply d̂_ij∈[10^{−2}, 10^{5}] m (≈1 cm to 100 km), which safely exceeds the 4 km map extent and prevents implausible distances from outlier RSSI or transient parameter values; they stabilize training without truncating valid links. The resulting edge features are interpretable and bounded, capturing environment‑dependent attenuation while allowing the GCN to model residual structure.

3.4 Anchor Handling

Anchors’ coordinates are provided as inputs and treated as fixed. During training and evaluation, predicted coordinates for anchors are overwritten with their known values and excluded from the loss. Message passing through anchor‑adjacent edges still informs unknown nodes.

3.5 Training Objective and Optimization

We minimize a robust Smooth L1 (Huber) loss on unknown nodes. L = ∑_{i∈U} ρ(p̂_i − p_i), where ρ is the Smooth L1 penalty. We apply weight decay to the model and path‑loss parameters (n, o) and use gradient clipping for stability.

The path‑loss module and GCN are trained jointly using Adam with weight decay. We do not use learning‑rate scheduling or early stopping. We train on standardized features/targets and evaluate on inverse‑transformed predictions. Key settings (optimizer, batch size, epochs) are listed in Table \ref{tab:hyperparams}.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Evaluation

4.1 Experimental Setup

We evaluate on synthetic, terrain‑aware outdoor scenarios that emulate a low‑density LoRa deployment. Propagation follows Longley–Rice over a 4 km × 4 km area. Nodes are at 1.0 m height. Each graph has 64 nodes (16 anchors, 48 unknowns). We collect K=10 RSSI samples per directed link to capture small‑scale variability.

Table \ref{tab:core_params} summarizes the experimental parameters.

Core parameters:

TAB: Core experimental parameters | tab:core_params | Applies to all experiments unless noted.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Area | 4 km × 4 km |
| Propagation model | Longley–Rice (terrain‑aware) |
| Carrier frequency | 915 MHz |
| Nodes | 64 total |
| Anchors / unknowns | 16 / 48 (ratio 1 to 3) |
| Node height | 1.0 m |

| Receiver sensitivity | −135 dBm |
| Coordinate frame | Latitude/longitude converted to local meters (fixed origin at 40.466198°, 33.898610°) |

4.2 Dataset Construction

We simulate a realistic deployment in Çorum Province, Turkey, covering a 4 km × 4 km area (see Fig. \ref{fig:exp_area}). This region was selected because public reports indicate frequent GPS interference, which motivates GNSS‑denied evaluation. CITE: gpsjam

FIG: images/experiment_area_comparison.png | Experiment area (4 km × 4 km): (a) Satellite view; (b) Terrain map. | fig:exp_area

We use a MATLAB generator to place 16 anchors (grid‑constrained within 4×4 tiles) and 48 unknown nodes sampled uniformly at random over the map area. For each directed pair (i,j), i≠j, we simulate K=10 RSSI samples. Self‑links are NaN. Positions are stored in latitude/longitude and converted to a local Cartesian frame using a fixed origin at (40.466198°, 33.898610°). To evaluate the impact of the physical environment, we generate datasets under two propagation regimes: a realistic terrain-aware setting using Longley-Rice, and an idealized free-space setting for comparison. We include both to show that iterative multilateration can perform very well in free‑space but degrades severely once terrain‑induced attenuation and shadowing are modeled. To avoid optimistic bias toward methods that implicitly assume line‑of‑sight, we report terrain‑aware results as the primary evaluation. The stark difference in RSSI distributions between these two regimes is visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:rssi_variance}.

FIG: images/rssi_variance_comparison.png | RSSI vs distance: (a) Terrain-aware; (b) Free-space. | fig:rssi_variance

We generate 1000 graph instances. Unless otherwise noted, we use a random 80/20 split for training/testing. For reporting across methods and both propagation regimes, we evaluate on N=200 held-out graph instances. Multilateration requires no training. GCN variants are trained on the training split and evaluated on the same N=200 graphs.

4.3 Training & Preprocessing

Inputs are node features [x, y, is_anchor] and edge attributes built from RSSI time series. For the proposed model, edges include the learned RSSI→distance estimate. The plain GCN ablation omits this term. We standardize features and targets on training data and overwrite anchor outputs with known coordinates at evaluation. Models are trained with first‑order optimization. Key hyperparameters are summarized in Table \ref{tab:hyperparams}.

4.4 Baselines

SUBSUBSECTION: Iterative multilateration with anchor expansion
A concise four‑step loop:

STEP 1: Estimate path‑loss (A, n) from anchor–anchor RSSI (averaged over K) via constrained fitting:

EQN: \mathrm{RSSI}(d) = A - 10\,n\,\log_{10}(d) | eq:mlat_rssi_model

STEP 2: Convert RSSI → distance on links incident to each unknown; clamp inputs and drop non‑finite or implausibly large values:

EQN: \hat d = 10^{\frac{A - \overline{\mathrm{RSSI}}}{10\,n}} | eq:mlat_rssi2dist

STEP 3: Multilaterate unknown nodes with ≥3 neighbors using bounded nonlinear least squares in 2D (trust‑region reflective), initialized at the current coordinate; anchors remain fixed.

EQN: \hat{\mathbf{p}}_i = \arg\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\mathcal{B}} \sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}(i)} (\lVert \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}_j\rVert_2 - \hat d_{ij})^2 | eq:mlat_ls

STEP 4: Anchor expansion: promote low‑residual updates to anchors and repeat Steps 2–4 for T=10; output final coordinates.

SUBSUBSECTION: Plain GCN ablation
Same architecture and training protocol as the proposed model, but without the RSSI→distance feature; all other components (graph, node features, edge attributes, NNConv configuration, optimizer, loss, masking, clipping, and evaluation) remain unchanged. This isolates the contribution of the physically informed edge attributes.

5. Results

5.1 Terrain‑Aware Results

We evaluate three methods and report localization error in meters. The methods are the proposed GCN with a trainable RSSI to distance module, a plain GCN ablation without this module, and iterative multilateration. Unless otherwise specified we use the terrain‑aware Longley–Rice setting with 64 nodes and K equals 10 RSSI samples per directed edge. All metrics are computed on N equals 200 held out graphs per method and setting.

Under the terrain‑aware setting, the proposed model achieves a mean error of 206.74 m, substantially improving over the plain GCN ablation (750.87 m) and iterative multilateration (1974.40 m). The error CDF and histogram show a consistent left‑shift and reduced upper tail for the proposed model relative to the baselines (Figs. \ref{fig:cdf_nonfree}, \ref{fig:hist_nonfree}). Table \ref{tab:main_results} reports full summary statistics.

We include the terrain‑aware CDF and histogram and representative qualitative maps for all three methods (Figs. \ref{fig:cdf_nonfree}, \ref{fig:hist_nonfree}, \ref{fig:qualitative_nonfree}, \ref{fig:qualitative_plain_nonfree}, \ref{fig:qualitative_mlat_nonfree}).

Under idealized propagation, multilateration attains a mean error of 6.28 m; the proposed model yields 51.15 m; and the plain GCN ablation yields 257.80 m. These results highlight that free‑space can invert the apparent ranking relative to terrain‑aware evaluation.

6. Discussion

6.1 Performance Drivers

The stark performance difference between methods stems from the fundamental challenge of inverting RSSI to distance in a terrain-rich environment. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:rssi_variance}, the relationship between RSSI and distance is not a simple function but a noisy, multi-modal distribution. This ill-posed inversion is the primary source of failure for iterative multilateration, which depends on accurate initial distance estimates. By committing to a single, often incorrect, distance for each RSSI measurement, it attempts to solve a geometrically inconsistent system, resulting in the catastrophic outliers evident in its error distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:hist_nonfree}).

Our proposed model overcomes this by reframing the problem. Instead of performing a hard RSSI→distance conversion, it uses the trainable path-loss module to generate a distance estimate that serves as a soft, physically-grounded prior. Critically, this estimate is supplied to the GCN as just one feature alongside the raw RSSI time series. The edge-conditioned convolution can then learn to weigh the physical prior against the underlying signal properties, effectively learning to trust or distrust the distance estimate on a per-edge basis. This provides the graph network with an essential understanding of physical scale that the plain GCN, which sees only unscaled RSSI values, fundamentally lacks.

Furthermore, the GCN architecture itself provides powerful regularization by enforcing local consistency through message passing. Unlike multilateration, which computes each node's position independently, the GCN performs collective inference across the entire graph. A node’s predicted position is constrained by its neighbors, smoothing the predictions and preventing the kind of large, isolated errors that plague the baseline (Fig. \ref{fig:qualitative_mlat_nonfree}). This graph-based reasoning is responsible for the dramatic reduction in the error tail (Table \ref{tab:main_results}, P90/P95), yielding a model that is not only more accurate on average but also substantially more robust.

The free-space results complete this picture. In an idealized environment where the log-distance model is correct (Fig. \ref{fig:rssi_variance}b), multilateration's direct optimization of a well-specified geometric cost function is superior. Our GCN, while still effective, is a more general function approximator and its global path-loss parameters cannot perfectly capture the geometry of every single graph instance as well as a direct least-squares fit can. This confirms that the proposed model's strength lies in its ability to robustly handle the uncertainty inherent in realistic, terrain-aware propagation environments.

6.2 Limitations

First, the study relies on simulated Longley–Rice propagation and controlled layouts. Although this model captures large‑scale terrain effects, a sim‑to‑real gap remains due to device heterogeneity, antenna placement, and temporal variability. Second, we learn global path‑loss parameters (\(P_t, n, o\)). Real deployments may require per‑region or per‑device parameterizations or mixtures to account for hardware and micro‑terrain diversity. Third, anchors are assumed accurate and static. In practice, anchor uncertainty can bias all methods; incorporating anchor priors with small covariances or jointly refining anchors with regularization would improve robustness. Fourth, we operate in 2D with fixed heights and do not model polarization or orientation. Finally, the current training objective is purely pointwise (MSE) and does not explicitly enforce geometric consistency; this choice favors simplicity but can leave small residual distortions.

6.3 Deployment

The results suggest a pragmatic workflow for LPWA networks in GNSS‑denied areas. (0) Before installation, synthesize a region‑specific dataset for the intended service area using the MATLAB Longley–Rice generator (available for any geographic region); place anchors according to the planned layout and sample unknown nodes, then pre‑train the model and scalers on these simulations. This yields a terrain‑matched prior and reduces cold‑start error. (1) After installation, collect anchor–anchor RSSI and run a short, label‑free calibration step that updates only the RSSI→distance parameters while keeping the GCN frozen (or lightly tuned); this aligns the physical module to the deployed hardware. (2) Lock anchors and run inference on unknown nodes; flag nodes whose predicted neighborhoods violate geometric sanity checks (e.g., large residuals across incident edges) and request additional RSSI samples for those links. (3) If persistent bias is detected, fine‑tune the full model on the region’s synthetic set and then perform a few gradient steps on unlabeled field data using self‑consistency losses. (4) For operational robustness, ensemble a small number of independently seeded models and average predictions; the histograms indicate that ensembling primarily trims the upper tail. (5) When planning new deployments, prioritize anchor dispersion and minimal shadowing to maximize graph connectivity; both baselines and our method benefit, but the GCN gains most from redundant paths.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Conclusion

We address beacon self‑localization in sparse LPWA networks using only RSSI and no GNSS‑disciplined timing. Our contribution is a physically informed, edge‑conditioned GCN that learns an RSSI→distance mapping jointly with message passing while keeping anchors fixed. This combination yields distance‑aware edge features that tame path‑loss bias and exploit unknown‑to‑unknown connectivity. In terrain‑aware evaluations over N=200 held‑out graphs, the model reduces mean error to 206.74 m compared with 750.87 m for a plain GCN ablation and 1974.40 m for iterative multilateration, and it markedly shrinks the heavy tail of the error distribution. Free‑space results confirm that classical multilateration excels under idealized propagation, reinforcing the need to evaluate with terrain and shadowing.

Beyond accuracy, we outlined an operational workflow: pre‑deployment, region‑specific training on MATLAB Longley–Rice simulations; post‑installation, label‑free calibration of the path‑loss module using anchor–anchor RSSI; and routine inference with sanity checks and optional ensembling. These steps are feasible with commodity hardware and scale to large outdoor areas.

Future work will: (i) bridge the gap between simulated training and real‑world evaluation via domain adaptation, calibration with anchor–anchor links, and robustness to device heterogeneity; (ii) optimize anchor placement to improve geometry and connectivity under cost constraints; and (iii) validate through field experiments across diverse regions with standardized metrics and ablations. We believe physically grounded graph learning, paired with terrain‑matched simulation and lightweight calibration, offers a viable foundation for dependable localization in GNSS‑limited environments.
