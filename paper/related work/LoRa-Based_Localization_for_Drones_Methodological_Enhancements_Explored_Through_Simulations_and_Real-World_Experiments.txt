ABSTRACT As the use of drones escalates, ensuring their reliable and accurate localization, especially
in potential GPS-compromised situations is crucial. This paper introduces a cutting-edge localization
method for drones, leveraging LoRa’s long-range, low-power capabilities, ideal for drone communication.
We especially focus on enhancing RSSI-based localization, commonly used for its simplicity yet prone to
inaccuracies due to the large variance in received signal strength. By integrating sensor-derived altitude
data and applying the Huber loss function in the optimization process of multilateration, our approach not
only outperforms traditional RSSI-based techniques in accuracy but also scales better with an increasing
number of beacons as demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments. These
results highlight our method’s applicability in various scenarios, such as emergency response, environmental
monitoring, or delivering in dense urban environments, where GPS reliability is uncertain. This research
makes a substantial contribution to the field of drone navigation, offering a robust alternative to GPS-reliant
systems and paving the way for enhanced autonomous drone operations in challenging environments.

I. BACKGROUND
The rise of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has rev-
olutionized a multitude of sectors, from commerce to
entertainment. These drones play pivotal roles in activities
such as surveillance [1], delivery [2], [3], and aerial photog-
raphy [4]. A fundamental requirement for these varied tasks
is accurate localization, traditionally dominated by GPS [5].
However, there are environments where GPS signals may be
weak or obstructed. In large indoor settings such as facto-
ries, stadiums, baseball fields, and underground structures,
GPS signals are often non-existent or severely weakened.
Even in outdoor environments, such as dense urban areas
with high-rise buildings, mountainous regions, and dense
forests, GPS faces challenges. Furthermore, in extraterrestrial

environments such as the Moon or outer space, GPS is
entirely unusable. In these scenarios, integrating alternative
localization techniques to provide redundancy to GPS is
crucial to ensure robust operation.
In recent years, Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN)
technologies have gained significant attention for their
potential to provide long-range communication with low
power consumption, which is ideal for applications such
as IoT and drone communication [6]. Among the LPWAN
technologies, LoRa stands out due to its large coverage area
of up to 15 km, yet low power consumption, and the ability
to work in various environments where GPS signals are
unavailable [7]. The use of LoRa in drone communication
and localization offers a promising alternative to conventional
methods.
The localization methods commonly used for drone navi-
gation can be classified into GPS-based and non-GPS-based

techniques. The latter includes Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI), Time of Flight (ToF), Time Difference
of Arrival (TDoA), and Angle of Arrival (AoA), among
others [8]. RSSI-based localization, in particular, is advan-
tageous due to its simplicity and the ability to function
without the need for high-cost and complex equipment. How-
ever, conventional RSSI-based methods often suffer from
inaccuracy due to signal attenuation, multipath propagation,
and interference [9]. Hence, enhancing the reliability and
accuracy of RSSI-based localization in drones forms the crux
of the research in this field.
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT
With the increasing use of drones in various applications,
there is a need to address the issue of drone localization
when GPS signals are lost. Currently, drones often rely on
GPS signals for their localization, and in case of GPS signal
loss, they try to maintain their position until GPS signal
recovery. However, due to the inaccuracy of dead-reckoning
through gyro and accelerometer, drones may not be able to
navigate as intended, leading to crashes. This issue raises
concerns about the safety and reliability of drone operations
in the future. In summary, the problem is the insufficiency
of GPS as a standalone localization solution for robust
drone operation, which necessitates alternative localization
methods that provide redundancy to the system.
III. OBJECTIVE
The primary objective of this paper is to propose a novel
RSSI-based positioning system with LoRa for drones.
We conduct simulations to evaluate the accuracy of our
proposed method in comparison to conventional localization
techniques under controlled conditions in various settings.
In addition to simulations, empirical studies are carried out
to assess the practical feasibility of the system and uncover
any potential issues that simulations alone may not reveal.
IV. RELATED WORK
There has been an increasing number of attempts to improve
the accuracy of the positioning system with LoRa protocol.
References [10] and [11] utilizes TDoA data for localization.
Although the TDoA-based method generally outperforms its
RSSI-based counterpart, it necessitates time synchronization,
which is realized through GPS as exemplified in [10]. How-
ever, given our aim of developing a LoRa-based positioning
system as a redundancy to GPS, dependence on GPS is not a
viable option. Other works [12], [13], [14], [15] have made
use of RSSI for localization. Whereas [12], [13], and [14]
employ a single antenna at each location for RSSI collection,
[15] incorporates two antennas to not only capture RSSI but
also Angle of Arrival (AoA) data. This results in a reported
accuracy of 3 m within a 55 m x 101 m field, although such a
setup requires custom and precise modifications to the device.
There have also been initiatives aiming at positioning
for aircraft utilizing LoRa. For example, [16] reports an
RSSI-based LoRa localization system for winged model
airplanes.
While these studies have advanced the field of drone
localization, they often face challenges such as the need
for complex setups, dependence on GPS, and significant
inaccuracies due to signal attenuation and multipath prop-
agation. Our RSSI-based approach addresses these issues
by integrating sensor-derived altitude data and applying the
Huber loss function in the multilateration process. This
combination not only enhances accuracy but also improves
scalability, making our system more robust and practical for
real-world applications.

V. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
A. SYSTEM DESIGN
Our proposed system envisions the utilization of multiple
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the airspace. Unique to
our system design is that it does not require bi-directional
communication, thereby eliminating the need for signal
traffic control as the number of UAVs increases. This aspect
of the design simplifies the system architecture and reduces
operational costs.
A challenge of this design, however, is the difficulty
associated with acquiring Time of Flight (ToF) or Time
Difference of Arrival (TDoA) data. These types of data
could offer more precise distance estimations but necessitate
synchronization of time between beacons and receivers. One
of the primary objectives of this research is to engineer
a cost-effective system compatible with existing hardware,
so our focus is solely on Received Signal Strength Indicator
(RSSI) data, which can be collected using readily available
hardware.
In terms of signal protocol, we have selected LoRa for
its ability to cover distances from a few to 15 km. This
range significantly reduces the number of beacons needed
compared to shorter-range wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi
or Bluetooth, as well as other LPWAN systems such as Sigfox
and NB-IoT. While these other LPWAN systems may offer
higher data rates, our system does not require the transmission
of substantial information. Instead, the relatively low-power
operation of LoRa makes solar-powered and battery-operated
beacons feasible. Additionally, obtaining modules for Pri-
vate LoRa is easier compared to other LPWAN systems.
These characteristics make LoRa an ideal choice for our
system.

B. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Our system places multiple beacons either in rural areas
or atop city buildings where they can maintain a clear line
of sight to the sky. These beacons emit LoRa signals at
random intervals, transmitting either their identification or
location data. Each UAV is equipped with a receiver capable
of detecting these signals (Fig. 1.) In the event of GPS failure,
the UAVs are designed to switch over to the LoRa-based
positioning system.
C. LOCALIZATION
The UAVs utilize received signals to extract the RSSI value
and the source location of the signal (lonbi, latbi, altbi) where
bi indexes the beacons. These RSSI values are then converted
into distance estimation di between the UAV and the beacon.
The conversion from RSSI to distance estimation is accom-
plished using a logarithmic model fitted with experimental
data, which is described as:
di = A log10(RSSIi) + B
(1)
where A and B are coefficients determined through curve
fitting on experimental data.
These sets of data ((lonbi, latbi, altbi) and di) are temporar-
ily stored in a cache where they can be used for localization
of the UAV before being discarded.
To perform localization, we convert the 3D geographic
coordinates of the beacons (lonb, latb, altb) to 3D Cartesian
coordinates (Xb, Yb, Zb). Then we use multilateration to
determine the location of the UAV. The primary constraints
for beacon i are expressed as
( ˆX −Xbi)2 + ( ˆY −Ybi)2 + ( ˆZ −Zbi)2 = d2
i
(2)
For optimizing the position estimate, the conventional
method uses the squared loss function which is defined as
L2(di, ˆdi) = (di −ˆdi)2
(3)
and minimize P L2(di, ˆdi), however, instead of the squared
loss function, we propose the use of the Huber loss function
which is defined as
Lhuber(di, ˆdi) =



1
2(di −ˆdi)2
if |di −ˆdi| ≤δ
δ|di −ˆdi| −1
2δ2
otherwise
(4)
and minimize P Lhuber(di, ˆdi)
The Huber loss function combines the advantages of
both squared loss and absolute loss functions, making
it particularly effective in scenarios where a balance is
needed between reducing the impact of significant errors
and avoiding the excessive punishment of minor deviations.
Squared loss is highly sensitive to small errors, which helps
in fine-tuning the accuracy of distance estimations. However,
it can disproportionately weight large errors, potentially
skewing the error minimization process. In contrast, absolute
loss is more resilient to large deviations, preventing outliers
from having too much influence, but it may be less precise in
minimizing smaller errors.
In our application, the inherent large variance in RSSI
values, caused by environmental factors such as signal atten-
uation and multipath propagation, often leads to substantial
estimation errors. The Huber loss function addresses this
challenge by behaving like squared loss when the error is
small (within a predefined threshold δ), ensuring precise error
minimization, and like absolute loss when the error is large,
thereby limiting the influence of outliers.
This dual characteristic allows the Huber loss function
to maintain robustness against the significant variances
in RSSI readings while still providing accurate distance
estimations for smaller errors. By employing the Huber loss
function, our system effectively mitigates the impact of these
variances, leading to enhanced accuracy and robustness in
the localization process. This makes the Huber loss function
particularly well-suited for improving the reliability of our
RSSI-based localization method in diverse and unpredictable
environments.
During the minimization process, altitude constraints are
integrated to enhance localization accuracy. These altitude
data are derived directly from onboard drone sensors such
as laser altimeters or barometers which utilize air pressure,
bypassing the need for GPS input. This integration helps
mitigate inaccuracies caused by signal attenuation and
multipath propagation, as the altitude data is captured by a
different system that does not suffer from these issues. Once
an estimated position in Cartesian coordinates is ascertained,
we first transition it to its equivalent geographic coordinates:
( ˆlat, ˆ
lon, ˆalt) =
to_gps( ˆX, ˆY, ˆZ)
(5)
Then, using the desired altitude constraint, it is converted
again into Cartesian coordinates:
(Xadjusted, Yadjusted, Zadjusted) = to_cartesian( ˆlat, ˆ
lon, altitude)
(6)
VI. SIMULATION
Since the experimental study is limited in terms of space,
number of beacons, and obstacles, we conduct a simulation
with omnnet++ to evaluate the performance of the proposed
method.
A. METHOD
1) LOCALIZATION TECHNIQUES
We conduct multilateration with 4 methods and compare the
results. We will refer to them as method 1–4.
• method 1:
Squared error loss (conventional method).
• method 2:
Squared error loss with altitude constraints.
• method 3:
Huber loss.
• method 4:
Huber loss with altitude constraints (proposed method).

2) SIMULATION SETUP
Our simulation is based on omnet++, which is a c++
simulation library and framework for network simulation.
On top of that, we utilize INET framework for mobile
networks, FLoRa [17] for simulating LoRa, and OSM
Buildings for 3D buildings to create a city environment.
The 3D map of our simulation contains the urban area of
1 tile in Berlin at the zoom level of 15 in open street map,
whose area is 0.5537 km2. 10 beacons are placed on top of
the 3D buildings that are randomly chosen. The altitude of
the drone is fixed at 100 m and the beacons emit 1 signal per
second to the receiver on the drone.
The parameters of the simulation are shown in Table 1.
TABLE 1. Simulation parameter.
TABLE 2. Results of static simulation.
3) SIMULATION SCENARIOS
Simulation is divided into two sections.
First, we compare the static accuracy, meaning that the
drone is hovering at one position, and we use the average
RSSI value of the signals that are emitted in 500 s so that
we can reduce the error in RSSI-to-distance conversion and
compare purely the difference between four methods.
Secondly, we compare the dynamic accuracy, meaning that
the drone is flying in a circle centered on the map area, with
a 200 m radius, and a speed of 10 m/s. We use 5 s as the
sample time for the received signals and update the position
with the frequency of 1 Hz, which is the normal frequency for
common GPS use.
For the RSSI-to-distance model, we conduct simulations
beforehand in an obstacle-free environment to collect data
correlating RSSI values with distances. This controlled
setting allows for the accurate measurement of RSSI values
at varying distances without interference from environmental
factors. Once this data are gathered, we apply least squares
regression to fit it to the logarithmic model (1).
B. RESULTS/EVALUATION
1) STATIC ANALYSIS
Fig. 2–5 shows a boxplot of the error in position estimation
in 2D/3D with methods 1–4, utilizing different numbers of
reference nodes. This is conducted by generating all possible
combinations of reference nodes and estimating positions
using only the signals from the selected beacon nodes.
Particularly, the results in 3D with methods 1 and 3, which
do not use altitude constraints, exhibit significantly higher
errors compared to the results in 3D with other methods. This
underscores the beneficial impact of incorporating altitude
constraints.
Fig. 5 (a) shows the occurrences of substantial error with
method 4, which is not observed with other methods. The
large value factor in the graph is intentional and highlights
significant outliers, a disadvantage of method 4. However,
as shown in Fig. 6, an R-squared value of 0.99 is obtained
by performing a linear regression analysis, suggesting a
very strong correlation between the minimization error
and the estimation error for method 4. This indicates that
substantial errors can be effectively addressed by monitoring
the minimization error during the multilateration process.

Table 2 shows the results of method 1-4 with 10 reference
nodes, displaying the error in both 2D and 3D. Fig. 7 shows
the difference of each method in the accuracy when the
number of reference node increases. It is evident that the

accuracy of methods that utilizes huber loss gets better with
more reference nodes when the one with squared error loss
worsens, which indicates better scalability of the proposed
method.
FIGURE 6. Correlation between minimization error and estimation error.
FIGURE 7. Comparison of localization error with method 1–4.
TABLE 3. Results of dynamic simulation.
2) DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
Table 3 shows the results of the accuracy in dynamic
simulation with methods 1–4.
In dynamic simulation, the accuracy markedly diminishes
compared to static scenarios due to the inherent variability
in RSSI-based distance estimations. However, our proposed
method outperforms others in terms of both median error and
standard deviation.
To enhance the system’s accuracy further, we recommend
more frequent data acquisition. This could be achieved by
increasing the frequency of beacon signals or by reducing
the drone’s speed. For example, at a reduced speed of
1 m/s, the system exhibits a much-improved median error
of 33.22 m and a standard deviation of 14.36 m in 2D with
method 4 according to our simulation with the said parameter.
It should be noted, however, that reducing the drone’s speed
increases energy consumption per travel distance, presenting
a trade-off.
3) SUMMARY
In summary, the simulation results show that our proposed
method is more stable and accurate compared to others
145992
VOLUME 12, 2024

in 2D/3D and static/dynamic scenarios, and it scales well
with an increased number of beacons. The main challenge
is the potential for large errors, which can be mitigated
by monitoring minimization errors. Additionally, the accu-
racy in dynamic scenarios is significantly lower than in
static scenarios but can be improved by reducing drone
speed.

VII. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY
The objective of this experiment is to validate the accuracy
of the proposed localization methodology and assess its
practical feasibility in a real-world setting.
A. METHOD
1) HARDWARE
The experimental setup utilizes readily available commercial
hardware components, as delineated in Table 4.
Fig. 8 shows the drone and one of the deployed beacons.
2) EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
The field tests are conducted in a parking area located in
Pergine, Italy. We position four beacons in a rectangle shape,
as illustrated in Fig. 9, and set them to transmit signals at
intervals modeled by a normal distribution with a mean value
of 0.5 seconds. The area surrounded by the beacons is 610 m2.
FIGURE 9. Map of the beacons.
Under handheld control at altitudes between 5–10 m, the
drone executes an oval maneuver in experiment 1 and pylon
eights in experiment 2. In autonomous control at an altitude
of 15 m, it performs an oval maneuver in experiment 3 and
pylon eights in experiment 4.
3) EVALUATION METHOD
Since beacon signals are more frequent than GPS data,
aligning them for evaluation can result in data mismatches.
We address this by employing interpolation on the GPS data,
estimating the drone’s GPS position at the precise moment of
signal reception.
B. RESULTS/EVALUATION
Table 5 presents the results of experiments 1 to 4, employing
methods 1–4. The table displays median errors and standard
deviations for 2D and 3D in each cell, formatted as ‘‘Med
2D/3D’’ and ‘‘Std 2D/3D’’, all values are in meters. For
methods 2 and 4, only a single set of values is shown for each
metric, as these methods yield identical results in 2D and 3D
due to altitude constraints.
In the practical implementation, our proposed method does
not show the same level of improvement over the conven-
tional method as observed in simulations. A contributing
factor is the limited number of 4 beacons used as opposed
to many. Furthermore, the outcomes from experiments 3 and
4 are less favorable than those from experiments 1 and 2. This
discrepancy is attributed to the antenna’s radiation pattern.
With the drone operating at a higher altitude in experiments
3 and 4, our model for correlating RSSI to distance proves less
adept. We present a more detailed exploration of this aspect
in the discussion section.
VIII. DISCUSSION
A. RSSI-TO-DISTANCE MODEL IMPROVEMENT
Fig. 10 depicts the RSSI-to-distance models derived from
data in experiments 1–2 and 3–4. The contrasting relational

trends between RSSI and distance arise from the beacon’s
monopole antenna configuration. The weakening of signal
strength directly above the antenna, despite its proximity,
becomes pronounced at greater altitudes, as evidenced by
Fig. 11.
FIGURE 10. RSSI-to-distance model. (a) trained with experiments 1–2.
(b) trained with experiments 3–4.
FIGURE 11. Signal strength in different altitudes.
A viable refinement to the RSSI-to-distance model
involves incorporating altitude parameters. Fig. 12 demon-
strates an altitude-adjusted model using data from exper-
iments 1 and 2. This model more accurately represents
radiation patterns at varying altitudes. However, imple-
menting this requires extensive data training and increases
computational demands due to the need for a large dataset and
advanced processing capabilities. Despite these challenges,
this refinement is a promising area for future research to
improve system precision.
FIGURE 12. RSSI-to-distance model with altitude parameter.
B. SAMPLING TIME OPTIMIZATION
Fig. 13 demonstrates the correlation between sampling times
for signal data and the observed median error and standard
deviation. This highlights the critical role of choosing the
suitable sampling duration tailored to the specific scenario.
In stable environments, longer sampling times reduce noise
impact, while dynamic conditions may require shorter
sampling times to capture real-time variations. Developing
adaptive algorithms to adjust sampling times based on
environmental conditions can optimize system performance,
enhancing accuracy and responsiveness in various scenarios.
This optimization is another promising area for future work
to further improve the adaptability and effectiveness of the
localization system.
C. COMPARISON WITH GPS
From the user’s perspective, both GPS and the proposed
system are straightforward to use with readily available
modules. LoRa receivers consume less power compared to
GPS receivers, offering an energy-efficient supplement. For
the system provider, the proposed method is simpler as it uses
RSSI without requiring time synchronization, unlike GPS
which depends on precise synchronization with satellites.
While GPS involves maintaining costly satellites, our system
requires more ground-based beacons, which are cheaper
and simpler to deploy and maintain. This ensures that the
proposed method effectively supplements GPS, balancing
energy efficiency, cost, and complexity.

FIGURE 13. Effect of Sample time on accuracy. (a) median error. (b) std.
D. SCALABILITY
The scalability of our proposed RSSI-based localization
method is supported by several key factors. Firstly, LoRa
technology’s long-range capability allows for coverage
areas of up to 15 km, reducing the number of beacons
needed. Secondly, the system design eliminates the need for
bi-directional communication, simplifying the architecture
and reducing operational costs as the number of UAVs
increases. Finally, the method can scale with an increased
number of beacons, improving localization accuracy propor-
tionally. These factors ensure the method’s suitability for
wide-area coverage and enhanced localization accuracy with
minimal infrastructure.
E. REAL-WORLD FEASIBILITY
Lastly, system deployment in real-world contexts neces-
sitates a cost-effectiveness analysis. Simulations indicate
a direct correlation between drone speed and localization
accuracy. Although the proposed method may not rival
GPS accuracy for a moving drone, operational adaptations
such as decelerating during critical phases (e.g., takeoff,
landing, or approaching destinations) can optimize precision.
According to our simulations, when the drone remains
stationary, achieving a median error of 11.63 m necessitates
a beacon density of 18.06 beacons/km2, and a median error
of 4.502 m requires a density of 7.223 beacons/km2.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this study, we introduce a new method for drone
localization using the RSSI values from LoRa beacons.
By incorporating altitude constraints and the Huber loss func-
tion, we aim to enhance the accuracy of drone positioning.
Our simulations show that our proposed method con-
sistently surpasses the conventional approach in terms of
accuracy and reliability. Our proposed method is able to
achieve a median error of 5.4m in static conditions. However,
this error increases to 62.98 m in dynamic situations,
primarily due to the unstable nature of RSSI values. One
potential solution is to reduce the drone’s speed. For instance,
when the drone’s speed drops to 1 m/s from 10 m/s, the
median error improves to 33.22 m, though at the expense of
battery life.
In real-world experiments, the results are better than
those of the dynamic simulations because of the lower
altitude and denser beacon environment. However, perfor-
mance decreases at higher altitudes, likely attributed to
the directional nature of antenna signals. By adapting the
RSSI-distance model to account for altitude, we believe we
can achieve more accurate estimation.
In summary, our experiments and simulations highlight
both the potential of our method and areas for further
refinement.
X. CONTRIBUTIONS
This research introduces the innovative use of Huber loss
combined with altitude constraints in the realm of localization
with RSSI data. Through simulations and real-world experi-
ments, we highlight the superiority of our proposed method
in comparison to the conventional method.
A key finding from our field studies is the uncovering
of additional errors attributed to antenna directivity, which
is not apparent in simulations. This crucial insight leads to
the promising approach of integrating an altitude variable
into our RSSI-to-distance model, effectively mitigating errors
linked to directivity.
