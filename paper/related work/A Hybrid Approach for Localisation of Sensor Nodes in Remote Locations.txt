A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network of sensor nodes using low-power wireless technology to
collect data in a region of interest (ROI). Due to their low energy, locating sensor nodes in large outdoor
areas is challenging, which precludes GPS integration. WSNs typically comprise a small number of beacon
nodes (BN) whose locations are known in advance, with most nodes deployed at unknown coordinates
within the ROI. Endeavours to determine the locations of such unknown WSN nodes are largely based
on the impractical assumption that every unknown node (UN) is within the communication range of BNs.
Subsequently, these approaches utilise at least two BNs to determine the position of one UN. The Received
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) or Angle of Arrival (AoA) values of the signals from the BNs form the
basis for such localisation. This article suggests an iterative hybrid approach incorporating AoA and RSSI
techniques, achieving accurate localisation with just one BN. The iterative method gradually covers the
region, avoiding the unrealistic assumption of having all UNs within range. It also presents an innovative
use of a unipolar stepper motor for AoA measurements. Experiments in a simulated environment and a
real-world prototype validate the approach’s effectiveness.

Introduction
A wireless sensor network (WSN) comprises a number of nodes, each laden with sensors of
various kinds and capable of communicating with other nodes through low-power signals. The
nodes gather ambient information from their surroundings and transmit the same from one node
to another, forming an ad-hoc network until a base station is reached [26]. To monitor a region
of interest (ROI), which is usually not easily accessible, a WSN is deployed with appropriate
sensors on each node. Any deviation from the normal in the ROI is expected to be picked up
by sensors of one or more nodes, and the base station is alerted. Environmental monitoring,

industrial automation, healthcare, agriculture, disaster management, and military surveillance are
a few applications of WSN [3]. Effective surveillance using WSN has several impeding factors like
limited energy, limited communication range, scalability [38], heterogeneity, and network security
[15]. Of these issues, the limited energy of nodes is crucial and has far-reaching consequences.
Energy limitations arise because the nodes in a WSN are usually deployed in inaccessible regions
and are most commonly powered by non-rechargeable batteries. It is impractical to access the
nodes and change the batteries. Thus, the utility of a node is limited by the lifetime of the batteries.
It is imperative, therefore, to prolong the life of the batteries as much as possible. One way of
doing this is through the use of exceedingly lightweight applications on the node. WSN nodes,
therefore, cannot make use of several common applications, a crucial one of which is the Global
Positioning System (GPS) used for accurate localisation. GPS sensors are typically heavyweight
and energy inefficient and are thus not appropriate for energy-starved WSN nodes. Localisation
of nodes in a WSN, therefore, becomes non-trivial [35]. Localisation of nodes is an important
exercise, especially when the WSN is deployed over a large area. An example of this is in one of
our projects Figure 1 wherein we utilise a WSN for early detection of forest fires in the Melghat
Tiger Reserve (a vital forest area located in Central India). In such scenarios, the WSN nodes
containing various sensors (like heat and temperature) are randomly deployed throughout the
area sometimes manually but mostly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This is because
most parts of the reserve are inaccessible to humans and UAVs are preferable. Although the placed
nodes are stable and static, the deployment through UAVs makes it impracticable to tag the nodes
a-priori. The deployed WSN nodes can detect a fire (using the sensors) and send an alert signal to
the base station using intermediate nodes and forming an ad-hoc network.
The base station learns that there is a fire but is unable to establish the precise location of the fire.
This is a serious problem as the tiger reserve spreads over an area of 3, 000 square kilometres, and
pinpointing the fire location is very difficult. Satellite images and drones are sometimes employed
for the localisation of fires, but these are effective only after the fire has become large and can be
seen above the trees, by which time significant damage is done. They are not helpful for early fire
detection systems.
There are several techniques used for localising nodes in a WSN. The approach taken by these
techniques is to utilise nodes whose locations are known called beacon nodes as a reference and
compute the locations of unknown nodes relative to beacon nodes. The localisation techniques
fall into one of two categories: range-based [14] and range-free [20]. Range-based techniques

[18] utilise hardware devices to determine the relative positions of unknown nodes from beacon
nodes by measuring the distance between them. Factors like the Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI) [4], Angle of Arrival (AoA) [43], and Time of Arrival (ToA) [44] are
employed to compute this distance. Range-free [21] techniques use information such as node IDs,
connection patterns, or topological data [48] to estimate the node’s location. Existing localisation
methods have several limitations: (1) They perform well in small regions where is common for
the unknown node to be within the communication range of two or more beacon nodes. However,
in more extensive regions, especially the outdoors, it is sometimes unrealistic for two or more
beacon nodes to be within the communication range of the unknown node. (2) multiple (two or
more) beacon nodes are required to localise an unknown node; and (3) the accuracy of localisation
is limited and the time required to localise the entire region is significant.
In this article, we propose a localisation approach that is effective over vast regions of interest
without the need for all nodes to be within communication range with each other. In fact, in our
technique, very few nodes are within the communication range of the initial beacon nodes. The
proposed approach takes an iterative approach to localise unknown nodes and is able to localise
nodes in the entire region in just a few iterations. A few unknown nodes close to the beacon nodes
are first localised. These newly localised nodes now become beacon nodes themselves and, in the
next round, localise other nodes close to them, and this process continues until the nodes in the
entire region are localised. This is made possible by the requirement in our approach for there
to be only one beacon node within the communication range of the unknown node for the latter
to be localised. This is a marked improvement over existing techniques that require at least two
and, ideally, more beacon nodes to be within the communication range of the unknown node. Our
approach employs a combination of the angle between the unknown node and the beacon node
(computed through the Angle of Arrival of signals) and the distance between the two (computed us-
ing the RSSI values) to achieve localisation. The key contributions of this article are summarised as
(1) Localisation of an unknown node using just one other node through the use of two factors:
angle and distance from a known node.
(2) An iterative approach to localisation is proposed that enables the coverage of a very large
area.
(3) An innovative and inexpensive approach to compute angle of arrival is presented in this
article and used for validation wherein a stepper motor is customised to move 360 steps per
revolution and is used for measuring the angle with an accuracy of 1◦.
The remainder of the article is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses existing techniques
for outdoor localisation in a WSN. This is followed by a detailed description of the proposed
approach in Section 3. Section 4 validates the efficacy of the approach through simulations and
real-world prototypical implementation, and finally, Section 5 concludes the article with pointers
to future work.

Previous Work
There is significant work done on localisation approaches for WSNs that are based on RSSI and
AoA. In this section, we discuss a few prominent endeavours.
The work described in [41] is closely related to ours. An RSSI and AoA-based method is proposed
in the article for localising multiple unknown targets (unknown nodes). Different from existing
algorithms that rely on complex mathematical tools that do not always yield feasible solutions, a
more straightforward approach was taken here: the article utilises available AoA measurements
and transitions from Cartesian to Spherical coordinates which allows the approximation of ini-
tially non-convex measurement models to linear ones. The iterative methods first localise some

unknown nodes with a localisation error; then, these newly localised (with some localisation error)
nodes help localise other unknown nodes. The localisation error propagated from one localised to
another in subsequent rounds is known as accumulative error. Our proposed method works itera-
tively and considers the accumulative errors from the previous rounds (just like feasible solutions),
representing the clear idea of waste areas. Also, our proposed approach is able to localise multi-
ple nodes per iteration, leading to much fewer iterations. In addition to this, the work in [41]
uses signals for the calculation of AoA, which is susceptible to disturbance and interference ad-
versely affecting accuracy. To overcome this, we propose the use of a simple stepper motor-based
mechanism, which is the most effective in free space models [9] (without any obstructions) for 2-
dimensional spaces. We also study the effectiveness of our approach in different types of terrains
that include: sandy, long grassy, and sparse tree terrains; which is again something that the earlier
approach does not look at.
In Reference [16], the authors address the node localisability problem in a network where a
few nodes are localisable. The authors propose the concept of partially localisable networks by
presenting theoretical conditions for a node to be considered uniquely localisable. Using this, lo-
calisable nodes are identified by dividing the network into redundantly rigid and reconnected
components. The method uses 10% of the nodes as beacon nodes (BN), whereas our proposed
approach uses only 1% of nodes as BNs. In spite of this, we are able to localise nodes over an ex-
tensive area and with greater accuracy. In [37], the authors propose an iterative multilateration
method that localises the unknown node (UN) using trilateration (using three BNs) repetitively.
The ToA used for distance measures have several disadvantages and obstacles in crowded areas
when compared with RSSI-based methods [19]. The proposed method takes advantage of iterative
multilateration to a great extent through its ability to localise a UN using a single BN. In the work
cited, a UN node needs to be within the communication range of at least three BNs. The method,
therefore, requires a very large number of beacon nodes when the density of unknown nodes is
large, which is quite cost-ineffective when deployed in the real-world. In [22], the authors propose
the sequential Monte Carlo localisation method and exploit the node’s mobility to improve local-
isation accuracy and precision. The localisation accuracy is established for three scenarios: when
UNs are statice and BNs are movable; when UNs are moving and BNs are stable; and when both
UNs and BNs are moveable. The approach utilises range-free methods for distance estimation. Our
proposed work uses a range-based approach for calculating the parameters, which is much more
accurate than range-free methods. Furthermore, the above method evaluates the results based on
simulations only and, even in these, uses a high BN density, which is hardly possible in realistic de-
ployments. In [47], the authors address an important issue in trilateration wherein the latter marks
a localisable graph as non-localisable. The approach can appropriately localise UNs that are one
hop away from participating in the trilateration exercise. The method uses trilateration and three
BNs to determine the location. The method uses trilateration and requires at least three BNs to
get the location of every unknown node. [27] proposes a novel localisability algorithm (i.e., Patch
and Stitching) wherein the whole network is initially divided into small localisable networks, and
subsequently joined together to form a global localisable network. Using an algebraic approach,
the work proposes a subset of localisable network merging conditions for 2D/3D networks. The
method uses trilateration for node localisability and can localise 90% of the network with 5% of
BNs. Our proposed method, on the other hand, takes a hybrid approach for localisation, and in
simulations is able to localise the whole network with only 1% of nodes acting as BNs. In [46], the
authors work on the localisability of the network to answer the following two questions: whether
it possible to say that a node is localisable or not while using a network graph; how many nodes
of the network are localisable and whether these can be identified? The localisability method uses
more nodes to localise unknown nodes in the network, where the proposed method takes a hybrid

approach and is able to efficiently localise most nodes using a very small number of known nodes
thus producing significantly superior localisability results. [45] deals with localisation accuracies
affected by outliers in range-based localisation methods. Earlier solutions, in general, use trian-
gle inequalities to deal with noisy data with outliers. The method proposed, on the other hand,
utilises a theoretical model based on graph embeddability and rigidity theory for the same. The
article designs a bilateration generic cycles-based outlier detection algorithm and tries to evaluate
its effectiveness through simulations and practical deployments. The method uses trilateration and
cycles-based outlier detection. The detection method is ineffective for more extensive settings and
likely fails to produce good results for larger outdoor areas. The proposed method discards the
outliers if they are out of the predefined region of the network and is thus more robust.
In Reference [12], a machine learning-based localisation approach for outdoor settings is pro-
posed. The approach employs virtual nodes to widen the dataset to address the issue of limited
training data. The method collects information from multiple access points and uses this infor-
mation to appropriately localise other unknown nodes. The approach is tested using simulations
that vary parameters like the number of sensors and anchor nodes, radio transmission power, and
wireless signal quality. In [30], the ARBL algorithm for outdoor localisation is proposed. This ap-
proach uses trilateration and reference node selection to determine the locations of sensor nodes.
A reference triangle through triangulation is formed in this approach, and using this, the ranging
inaccuracies are evaluated. The sensor node positions are based on these inaccuracies. Notably,
the innovation in this work lies in selecting the optimal anchor node for the localisation process.
The approaches in [12] and [30] are relatively impracticable. The former is because it is pretty
challenging to implement, and the latter is because it requires at least three beacon nodes to lo-
calise an unknown node, which is hard to get in outdoor environments. In [23], the AoA and RSSI
differences-based localisation method (ALRD) is proposed. In this method, the AoA is estimated by
comparing the RSSI values of beacon signals received by two perpendicularly oriented directional
antennas installed at the same place. Subsequently, two methods (maximum point minimum di-
ameter and maximum point minimum rectangle) are proposed to minimise the ALRD localisation
error. In [25], the authors propose a simplified combination of the AoA and RSSI methods. The
calculations of the AoA require complex antenna arrays. The proposed approach (1AoA/nRSSI)
uses the AoA values from only one anchor node in combination with n RSSI values to estimate
the location of an unknown node. The method is suitable for shadowing environments and when
more precise RSSI values are available.
In Reference [49], a fingerprint-based WSN localisation technique is proposed for indoor and
outdoor use. The objective of this work is to enhance fault tolerance and system efficiency. A pre-
cision of 5 m and 10 m was attained, respectively, in this technique for pedestrian and driving
tests using phones for evaluation. In [36], multiple indoor and outdoor localisation approaches for
WSN are analysed. The authors illustrate the applicability of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
approaches in modern technologies like WSN-IoT [29], cognitive radios, and 5G networks. Cen-
tralised and distributed MDS techniques for indoor and outdoor localisation are discussed in the
article. In [40], a localisation technique for mobile nodes in wireless sensor networks is proposed.
The strategy targets short beaconing intervals and localisation deviations stemming from radio
propagation. It solves these issues through geometric least square curve fitting. In [8], a technique
is proposed that employs curve fitting for wireless sensor networks and a range-based approach
for outdoor localisation is proposed. The techniques discussed in [36, 40, 49], and [8] are applicable
in both indoor and outdoor environments. However, their localisation processes were tested on
limited confines, potentially constraining their effectiveness in large areas.
For indoor localisation, [32] suggests a hybrid approach using particle swarm optimisation
(PSO) and the global best local neighbourhood approach. This approach employs three anchor

nodes to locate an unknown node. It achieves a localisation inaccuracy of 0.44 m in a simulated
environment. RSSI values are used for distance estimation between nodes, and the mean error
varies with network size changes. In [11], a range-free localisation technique is proposed using
a fusion of Harris Hawks optimisation and area minimisation. The technique categorises neigh-
bours into incoming and outgoing for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. It employs area
minimisation to reduce the node’s predicted region. The technique is simulated for small areas in
2D and 3D environments. In [39], a heuristic approach is introduced to tackle anisotropy-related
challenges in WSN, which can lead to localisation errors. The proposed range-free approach incor-
porates geometric constraints and hop-based strategies to mitigate this problem. The techniques
in [32], [11], and [39] are indoor localisation strategies that pose challenges when applied to larger
areas. Implementing these for expansive spaces is arduous and mostly not feasible.

Proposed Approach
The proposed approach for localisation of nodes in a WSN is simple and is the first localisation en-
deavour, to the best of our knowledge, that is effective in very large areas. Localisation approaches
until now have been limited by the assumption that the region of interest is small enough for all
nodes to be within communication range of each other. This is quite unrealistic for large outdoor
areas like forests or glaciers. Here, regions of interest are often spread over thousands of square
kilometres, and the communication range of a WSN node is within 100 meters. In the proposed
approach, we overcome this vital limitation and initiate with the modest requirement that the co-
ordinates of a minimal number of the nodes in the region of interest be known. This is a realistic
expectation as parts of the regions of interest, especially along the periphery, are usually accessible.
The locations of such nodes are computed using external GPS devices. The nodes whose locations
cannot be determined and need to be localised are deep within the regions of interest that are
mostly hostile and inaccessible. Examples include forest regions whose peripheries are accessible,
but the inner core is hostile and inaccessible; similarly, it is easy to access the periphery of a glacier
but very difficult to move deep into it.
The first contribution of our approach is the capability of accurately localising an unknown
node using the coordinates and signals from just one known beacon node. This is a significant
improvement over existing techniques that require at least two beacon nodes to localise an un-
known node. This contributes in substantial measure to the capability of localising a very large
number of unknown nodes using a very small number of beacon nodes. Subsequently, in Section 4
(Experimental Evaluation), we try to localise most unknown nodes with just 1% of nodes being
beacon nodes.
A predefined beacon node (mostly at the periphery of the region of interest) sends a signal to an
unknown node that is within its range of communication. The unknown node registers the RSSI
and the AoA of the signal from the beacon node. The RSSI value is used to determine the distance
of the beacon node from the unknown node, and the AoA is used to determine the relative angle
between the two. Combining these two factors leads to an accurate localisation of the unknown
node.
The now localised “unknown” node is no longer unknown and becomes a new beacon node. This
new beacon node now sends a signal to another unknown node within its range of communication,
and in a similar manner, this unknown node is localised and becomes yet another beacon node. This
process continues till all the nodes are localised or a beacon node does not have any unknown node
within its range of communication. Figure 2 is a high-level depiction of the localisation process,
and Algorithm 1 describes the same in more detail. The following subsections describe in detail the
process of computing the distance between nodes based on the RSSI value of the received signal,
the computation of the angle between the nodes based on the Angle of Arrival of the signal, and

Node Distance Using RSSI
The power level in a received radio transmission is measured by the RSSI. The strength of a wireless
link is commonly measured in decibel-milliwatts (dBm), with a large number indicating a strong
signal and superior link quality. In addition to identifying issues with wireless interference, RSSI
is used to calculate the distance between a wireless device and the access point to which it is

connected. The distance is calculated using the following relation:
RSSI(dBm) = 10 ∗loд10 (Pr/P0) ,
(1)
where Pr is the power level received at the receiver, and P0 is the reference power level (usually
expressed as the received power at a distance of one metre from the transmitter). It is important
to note that factors like distance, obstructions, and interference have a significant impact on the
RSSI value. The precise value of RSSI, therefore, changes based on these. Also, the measurements
and reference values used by various wireless technologies and manufacturers have a bearing on
the computed RSSI value.
The approach proposed in this work also incorporates the path loss values incurred owing to
the nature of the environment while computing the RSSI values. The environments include: the
free space model (with no obstructions); sandy terrain [2]; long grassy terrain [1]; and terrains
with sparse trees [2]. We endeavour to establish a mapping between these environments and the
RSSI values by employing specific equations to calculate their respective path loss values:
Lp = PL0 + 10 ∗α ∗loд10 (Pr/P0) + Xσ,
(2)
E1 = 60.97 + 10 ∗3.42 ∗loд10 (Pr/P0) + 3.02,
(3)
E2 = 59.42 + 10 ∗2.56 ∗loд10 (Pr/P0) + 3.84,
(4)
E3 = 60.98 + 10 ∗3.33 ∗loд10 (Pr/P0) + 7.30.
(5)
In this context, PL0 denotes the path loss value at a reference distance ofd0 measured in dB, while
α signifies the path loss exponent, indicating that the rate of path loss increases as the logarithm
of the distance. Additionally, Xσ represents a normally distributed random variable with a mean
of zero and a standard deviation of σ. The path loss values in sandy terrains, long grassy terrains,
and sparse tree terrains are denoted as E1, E2, and E3, respectively.
Our algorithm proposes the calculation of the RSSI value using Equation (1) to determine the
signal strength between the unknown node and the beacon nodes.
3.1.1
RSSI to Distance. The computation of the RSSI value over various terrains makes it possi-
ble to determine the distance separating the unknown node from the beacon node. This distance,
combined with the angle measurements, serves to determine the position of the unknown node.
The distance, d, is calculated as follows using the RSSI value:
d = 10

Pm −RSSI
10∗N

.
(6)
Where RSSI indicates the strength of the signal from the beacon node as received at the un-
known node, measured power Pm indicates the RSSI value of the signal at 1 meter from the beacon
node, and N is a constant (with a value between 2 and 4) that depends on the environmental factors.
3.2
Angle of Arrival (AoA)
AoA is the angle between a wave’s propagation and a reference direction, also referred to as orien-
tation. The orientation is expressed in degrees clockwise from the North. The AoA is absolute when
the orientation is 0 or pointed to the North; otherwise, it is relative. The Angle of Arrival can be
determined using radio waves, Bluetooth, RFID, or WiFi signals. Earlier, the AoA was determined
via radio waves by arranging four antennas squarely on each anchor node. This facilitates angle-of-
arrival computations [24] by adjusting the phases of signals across the antennas. A rotating beacon
is generated by directing the maximum radiation from the antenna array. This process employs
the scanning phased array technique, known as beamforming. The technique guarantees that four
radio waves constructively interfere in a specified direction [7]. More recently, the demand for

cost-effective indoor localisation systems has led to the adoption of more innovative approaches
like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies
for computing the AoA. The AoA information is obtained using BLE devices in two ways:
(1) through Switched Beam Systems (SBS) and (2) using Adaptive Array Systems (AAS). The
SBS approach scans the azimuth plane using a fixed number of beams to identify the direction with
the highest received power or signal strength. The AAS, on the other hand, allows beam steering
in any desired direction by altering weights across the antenna array elements [31]. Alternatively,
RFID-based solutions use UHF RFID transponders and multiple directional antenna arrays. Given
the normally narrow bandwidth of RFID communication channels, the AoA approach becomes es-
sential, especially in environments tending to severe multi-path conditions. By analysing the phase
difference between incoming signals, the AoA method relies on isolating a strong line-of-sight
(LOS) path from other signal paths to estimate the transponder’s position accurately [5].
In the presented work, our primary emphasis is on localisation. Implementation of the AoA
computation method is beyond the scope of this work, and we do not dwell on it. For our real-world
prototypical implementation, we use a stepper motor mounted with a laser for AoA calculations
(the detailed description is mentioned in Section 4.3). For simulation, the Equation (7) shows the
calculation of AoA values between three points:
Anдle = deдrees(atan2(Ny −BNy, Nx −BNx) −atan2(U Ny −BNy,U Nx −BNx)).
(7)
Where U N, BN, and N are the unknown nodes, beacon node and the pointer towards the north
axis, respectively. The two-argument arctangent or atan2(y,x) calculates the angle in radians be-
tween the positive x-axis and the line from the origin to the point (x, y) in the Cartesian plane.
The resulting angle falls within the range of −π < θ ≤π. Equation (7) is the approach adopted to
calculate the AoA in simulations.
The AoA of signals of at least two beacon nodes usually are required to localise an unknown
node. However, the proposed approach overcomes the limitation of requiring at least two beacon
nodes. It is able to effectively localise an unknown node using a single beacon node through the
combined use of the RSSI value and the AoA measurement. Figure 3 demonstrates the combina-
tion of the distance computed using RSSI values and the AoA to determine the location of the
unknown node. The X and Y axes of the unknown node are as computed in Equation (8) using
simple trigonometry.
XU N = dRSSI sin(AoA),

YU N = dRSSI cos(AoA).

Fig. 5. The nodes with green and red circles represent the initial beacon nodes and unknown nodes, respec-
tively. The green triangles represent the predicted location of a nearby unknown node. In multi-iteration,
some unknown nodes are localised in every iteration with some error, and this will increase with the itera-
tion round.
3.3
Multi-iteration
As explained in the last sections, the RSSI and AoA values of a signal from a beacon node enable
the effective computation of the location of an unknown node that lies within the communication
range of the beacon node. The use of RSSI and AoA together makes precise localisation possible
with just one beacon node [17]. Subsequent to localisation, an unknown node becomes a “new”
beacon node. The RSSI and AoA values from this new beacon node now become the basis for the
localisation of subsequent nodes that fall within its communication range. This localisation process
continues through several iterations until all the nodes in the region of interest are localised, or a
scenario is arrived at with no unknown nodes within the communication range of beacon nodes.
Figure 4 is a simple depiction of the progress of the localisation process.
In multi-iteration, initially, unknown nodes are localised (with some localisation error) using
beacon nodes. The newly localised nodes subsequently play the role of beacon nodes in the
following iterations and facilitate the localisation process further. The newly localised nodes
have some more localisation error, which is a result of the error in their own localisation, and
also the error carried over from the previous localisation. The localisation error, in this way,
accumulates and increases through iterations, as shown in Figure 5. We use a combination of
angle and distance to predict the location of any unknown node using only one beacon node, so
the localisation error is small for initial iterations (less than 0.25m). The requirement of only one
beacon node for localisation helps hasten the localisation process and converge the network faster.
The result of this is that most localisations happen during the initial iterations, and the error is
significantly minimised. A large number of localisation iterations would be counterproductive as
the localisation errors accumulate with progressive iterations.

Network Localisability
The ground truth of the WSN network is depicted using a distance graph G = (V, E), where
V depicts the WSN nodes, and E represents an unweighted edge (i, j) ϵ E between nodes i and

j. A graph/network is localisable if there is a unique location for every node in the graph and
the distance between nodes i and j, d(i, j): E −→R conforms to certain conditions (in this case:
the distance being less than the communication range (CR) of the WSN nodes). Network local-
isability can be widely used in network deployment, routing, energy management, and mobility
control [28].
A successive localisable algorithm can be used to verify the localisability of a graph that
harnesses iterative localisation. Existing solutions use the trilateration method to determine
node localisability in a network, hence they use four connected components (K4) to verify
the localisability. The proposed algorithm, on the other hand, uses only one beacon node and
thus there are only two connected components (K2) involved in determining the location of an
unknown node. Algorithm 2 is the successive localisability algorithm for our proposed method.
The necessary and sufficient condition for node localisability is that the node, represented by
vertex v, must be one hop away from a beacon node.

Experimental Evaluation
This section is dedicated to examining the effectiveness of the proposed localisation approach
through experiments. The evaluation process comprises comprehensive validation of the approach
in a controlled environment using simulations. This is followed by an assessment of the approach
in a real-world setting through a prototypical implementation. Section 4.1 contains information
on the simulation environment and the parameters employed in the experiment. The results of
the experiments conducted over the simulated environment and comparison with other state-of-
the-art methods are discussed in Section 4.2. Finally, Section 4.3 demonstrates the efficacy of the
approach in the real-world through a prototypical implementation.
4.1
Simulation Environment and Parameters
The proposed protocol is implemented using Python [42] and evaluated using a Kaggle Kernel on
a system that comprises an Intel (R) Xeon (R) CPU from the Haswell CPU family, 16 GB RAM,
and four CPUs with a frequency of 2.30 GHz each. A GPU is used to handle computationally
intensive tasks, such as conversion of RSSI values to distance and Angle of Arrival calculations.
The calculations involve large matrix values, and these can be efficiently computed in parallel
using a GPU, especially since the calculations are independent of each other.

Table 1 contains information on the simulation environment and the parameters used in the
simulations to comprehensively assess the efficacy of the proposed localisation approach. The
parameters used in the simulation are described in detail as follows:
— Region of Interest (Rx): Different sizes of square regions of interest are experimented with.
The regions of interest are categorised into two types, R1 and R2. The smaller regions of
interest fall within R1, and the larger ones within R2. The different sizes of R1 and R2 used
are shown in Table 1. Running the experiments on different sizes of the region of interest
provides insight into the impact of the latter on the efficacy of our algorithm.
— Initial Unknown Nodes (IU N): Initial Unknown Nodes (IUNs) are nodes whose coordi-
nates are not known initially and which are localised using the proposed approach. The
number of IUNs is widely varied, as shown in the table for a thorough assessment of the
approach. This is a good yardstick by which to assess the proposed approach.
— Original Beacon Nodes (OBN): There is a very small number of Original Beacon Nodes
(OBN), which are nodes whose locations are assumed to be known in advance. The number
of OBNs is expressed as a percentage of unknown nodes, IUN, and varies between 1% and
5%. Experimenting with a small number of OBNs gives an idea of the utility of the approach
as it appropriately demonstrates how such a small number of nodes forms the genesis of
localising a large area. The distribution of the OBNs is also varied along the following lines:
Equidistant Deployment on the Boundary (EDB), where the OBNs are deployed on the
boundary of the region of interest and are equidistant from each other; Random Deploy-
ment at Boundary (RDB), where the OBNs are deployed randomly (not necessarily in an
equidistant manner) on the boundary of the region of interest; and Random Deployment
(RD), where the OBNs are randomly deployed in the region of interest and not necessarily
only at the boundary.
— Communication range (CR): The node’s communication range implies the distance that a
radio signal sent from a node travels. The magnitude and direction of these radio signals
form the basis for assessing the distance and angle, respectively, of an unknown node from
the known beacon node. Hence the CR plays a vital part in ensuring the efficacy of the
approach. Varying the CR and assessing the effectiveness of the approach gives an idea of
its utility in a heterogeneous deployment of nodes. For a better understanding of the effect
of CR on localisation accuracy, we experiment with different values of communication range
(as shown in Table 1) for both small and extensive regions.
— Environment Noise (Ex): Environment noise is a factor that impedes the smooth passage of
radio signals between nodes. This is an important factor and needs to be analysed as the pas-
sage of radio signals plays an important role in assessing the relative positions of unknown

nodes and, subsequently, their localisation. A value of 0 for x implies no disturbance in the
medium, and progressively larger values of x indicate noise and disturbance. The noise can
be due to factors like irregular surfaces like sand, tall grass, trees and so on. A few values
of x are experimented with in our simulations, and these correspond to surfaces with sand
Equation (3), grass Equation (4), and sparse trees Equation (5). The effect of these on the
localisation efficacy of the proposed approach is assessed.
4.2
Simulation Results
All possible combinations of parameters in Table 1 are experimented with, and the following fac-
tors are used to express and comprehend the outcome and efficacy of the proposed localisation
method:
— Number of iterations (NIT): This factor specifies the number of times that the multi-iteration
algorithm runs to localise the network to the maximum possible extent. Further iterations
beyond NIT do not result in the localisation of any further node. The network localisation
process depends critically on this value; the fewer the number of iterations, the quicker the
network localisation process.
— Unknown nodes Remaining (U NR): U NR is the count of nodes that remain unlocalised at
the end of the localisation process due mainly to not being within the communication range
of any beacon node; the smaller this number, the better the algorithm.
— Localisation Error (LE): The Euclidean distance between the node’s actual position and the
position determined by the proposed approach expresses the localisation error.
Localisation Error (LE) =

(Xactual −Xpredicted)2 + (Yactual −Ypredicted)2,
(10)
— Average localisation error (ALE): The average localisation error is calculated as
Total Localisation Error (TLE) =
n

i=1
LEi,
(11)
ALE =
TLE
(IU N −U NR).
(12)
— Localisation time (LT): The localisation time expresses the time (in seconds) expended to
localise the network to the maximum possible extent. This factor provides an important
insight, and values of LT beyond a certain limit may be unacceptable.
4.2.1
Experimental Environment. The experiments over the simulation environments were con-
ducted with the intent of gaining insight into the efficacy of the proposed localisation approach
under varying circumstances. The first factor that varied was the size of the region of interest
(ROI). The sizes of the ROI that we experimented with vary between 1000 × 1000 square meters
and 7000 × 7000 square meters. These are reasonably large outdoor locations, and any localisation
approach effective in such an area can safely be assumed to be effective in outdoor locations of
any size. The reason we restricted ourselves to simulation regions up to this size and not beyond
is that the computation time was becoming exorbitantly long, and it was becoming difficult to
conduct these with the computing resources available to us. The localisation error (LE), number
of iterations (NIT) required to complete the localisation process, the number of nodes remaining
unlocalised (U NR) at the end of the localisation exercise, and the localisation time (LT) were ob-
served for different sizes of the region of interest. In addition to this, through the simulations, we
tried to gain an understanding of the efficacy of our approach in various kinds of terrains. A fac-
tor called Environmental noise (Ex) discussed earlier, is introduced to represent different kinds of
ACM Trans. Sensor Netw., Vol. 21, No. 2, Article 23. Publication date: March 2025.

terrains. E0 represents a perfectly smooth terrain that is not realistic but useful as a benchmark;
E1 indicates a sandy terrain; E2 is a grassy terrain; and finally, E3 is a terrain with sparse trees.
Each of these terrains is progressively noisier than the earlier one and impedes the smooth
passage of signals between the WSN nodes. It is important that the effect of the signal passage in
various kinds of terrains be understood, as the latter forms the basis of our localisation exercise.
The deployment of the WSN nodes in the simulation environment is done in a manner that
simulates a real-world deployment. The initially unknown nodes (IU N), the nodes whose locations
are to be determined, are randomly deployed over the entire region of interest. The original beacon
nodes (OBN), the nodes whose locations are known in advance, are very small in number and
are deployed in three ways: (1) Randomly (RD) across the region of interest. This deployment
scheme for beacon nodes conforms to parts of the region of interest that are accessible with GPS
connectivity and where the node’s original locations can be determined. These could correspond to
zones in a forest area, for example, that are in clearings and have GPS connectivity; (2) Equidistant
along the boundary (EDB), this is a realistic deployment for beacon nodes as the peripheries of the
region of interest are usually accessible and the location of nodes can be determined in advance
through GPS. In this scheme, the beacon nodes are equidistant from each other; and (3) Randomly
on the boundary (RDB), the beacon nodes are again on the periphery and are randomly deployed
at the periphery and are not necessarily equidistant. The three schemes of deployment give an idea
of the nature and effectiveness of the proposed localisation approach for varied kinds of regions
of interest.
Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 show the results of the average values for various parameters described
above to assess the efficacy of the proposed approach in different sizes of the region of interest with
different terrains and with different deployment schemes for the beacon nodes. The comprehensive
results are very large in number and cannot be shown here but are available for the interested
reader at the following url.
4.2.2
Visualisation of the Localisation Process. In this section, we visualise the localisation pro-
cess in a simulation set-up comprising a large number of initially unlocalised nodes (IU N) and a
very small number of original beacon nodes (OBN). There are three visualisations (for ROI, IU N,
and OBN is 3000 × 3000 m2, 4000, and 1%, respectively), one for each of the three deployment
schemes for the OBNs. The visualisations depict the process of localising unknown nodes through
localisation epochs, ultimately converging to the localisation of all nodes or a majority of the nodes.
Figure 6 depicts the localisation of nodes when the OBNs are randomly deployed over the entire
region of interest. The OBNs are coloured blue and are very small in number in comparison to the
unlocalised nodes, IU Ns, shown in red. As the IU Ns are localised, their colour changes from red to
green. Figure 7 depicts the localisation process when the beacon nodes are deployed at the bound-
ary of the region of interest and equidistant from each other. Finally, Figure 8 depicts the localisa-
tion process for OBNs deployed randomly at the boundary of the region of interest. The intent of
the visualisations is to help the reader appreciate the process and better comprehend its progress.
The number of iterations required to localise theU Ns varies owing to differences in deployment
type of the original beacon nodes (OBNs). Random deployment (RD) of OBNs across the entire
region mostly leads to fewer iterations when compared to deployment of OBNs on the boundaries
(equidistant (EDB) or random (RDB)). Random deployment (RD) of beacon nodes over the entire
region makes them proximate to a much larger number of unknown nodes per iteration, thus
localising them immediately and leads to fewer iterations. Similarly, OBNs deployed randomly on
the boundary (RDB) require fewer iterations than whenOBNs are deployed in a strictly equidistant
manner on the boundary (EDB). In Figures 6, 7, and 8, the deployment of the initial unknown
nodes (IU N) and the OBNs is random, and visualisation is shown for an area of size 3000 × 3000

m2. The EDB deployment follows a particular pattern for localising unknown nodes (as seen in
Figure 7), resulting in fewer U NRs (seen as red nodes) than the RDB. In the case of RDB, however,
the localisation follows irregular patterns and may end up with more U NRs (seen as red nodes),
which adversely varies the number of iterations required to localise the entire region.

solution for localisation irrespective of the nature of the region. The first factor that we study is the
size of the region of interest (ROI). Figure 9 shows the effect of variation of the area of the region
of interest on: the average localisation error (A −LE), the number of unknown nodes remaining
(U NR), the number of iterations (NITs) required to localise most of the nodes in the ROI, and the
localisation time (LT) taken to localise the entire ROI.
To provide a more precise visualisation of the effects, the following configurations were used
for plotting the figures. Two ROI sizes are experimented with: small regions (R1) with size ranging
from 1000 × 1000 to 4000 × 4000 square meters; and extensive regions with size ranging from
5000 × 5000 to 7000 × 7000 square meters. The number of unknown nodes, IU N, to start with is
15, 000. The number of beacon nodes, OBNs is 1% of the known beacon nodes which works out
to 150. The OBNs are deployed along all three schemes, randomly throughout the region (RD),
randomly at the boundaries (RDB), and at the boundaries equidistant from each other (EDB). The

communication range of WSN nodes also varies in real deployments and the same is simulated
by varying the communication range of radio signals between nodes. The communication ranges
experimented with are 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m, for small regions (R1); and 75 m and 100 m for
extensive regions (R2). We do not experiment with 50 m in extensive regions as the nodes in these
regions are sparse and 50 m becomes too small a range for effective localisation. The effect of
change in area of the ROI on each factor is discussed as follows:
— Average Localisation Error (A −LE): The average localisation error varies very slightly as
the size of the ROI increases. This validates the claim that the proposed model can be used
for localisation in outdoor locations of any size with a satisfactory degree of accuracy. In
fact, there is a very slight reduction in the localisation error with an increase in the ROI size
which bodes well for the performance of the system in even larger ROIs.
— Unknown Nodes Remaining (U NR): The number of initial unknown nodes, IU Ns, that re-
main unlocalised at the end of the localisation process is near zero for smaller ROIs but for
large ROIs this number increases suddenly. This is because a larger ROI leads to several
nodes falling beyond the communication range, CR of the nearest known node. The Un-
known Nodes Remaining U NRs are mostly near zero when the communication range being
considered is large (75 m and 100 m). This is because a large communication range leads
to almost all unknown nodes falling within the range of at least one beacon node and thus
being localised. This is especially so when the distribution of IU Ns is random. The number
of U NRs is large when the communication range is small (50 m). For R1 regions, the number
of U NRs is small for S1, S2, and S3, and has an average value of 0.02, 0.28, and 36.91 nodes.
This value is higher for the S4 region with the average being 317.90. There is a large differ-
ence in U NRs in areas (S1, S2, and S3) and S4 because the same number of IU N is distributed
in different area sizes. The deployment thus becomes dense for S1, S2, and S3 as these are
smaller in size compared to S4. Similarly, for R2 regions, when the communication range is
small (75 m), the number of U NR for area sizes S5, S6, and S7 has an average value of 8.42,
30.96, and 318.73. Just like the case of R1 region, the A −U NR is low for areas S5 and S6
compared to that for S7 because the deployment of IU N is dense in the former. These results
are for free space environment (E0) when the beacon nodes are placed randomly throughout
the regions. In a similar manner, the results are computed for three other environments with
two other deployment types and can be accessed at the following URL.
— Number of Iterations (NITs): The NITs needed to localise the entire ROI in general increases
with the region size. Yet, in some cases (as seen in Figure 9 (for NITs)), the NITs remain
constant beyond a certain size of the ROI. This is because the U NR, as explained in the last
point, increases for larger ROIs, and the number of iterations required for localisation is
unchanged.
— Localisation Time (LT): The time required to localise the entire ROI increases with an in-
crease in size of the region. This is along expected lines as a larger ROI leads to a larger
number of iterations (NITs) and hence time. There is a slight decrease in the LT, however,
when the assumed communication range, CR, of the nodes is large. This is because a larger
CR results in further nodes, and in effect, a larger number of nodes being localised in each
iteration and hence a smaller LT. Another phenomenon, not as common, is the decrease in
LT with an increase in the size of the ROI. The reason for this could be due to a larger num-
ber of nodes remaining unlocalised (U NR), leading to a smaller number of nodes localised,
and effectively smaller LT.

sents the communication range and deployment type (like 50m_EDB represents the EDB type of deployment
with 50m communication range of a node).
Error (A −LE); the number of unlocalised nodes remaining (U NR); the total number of iterations
(NITs) required to localise the entire ROI; and the localisation time (LT) to localise the ROI (LT).
The graphs in Figure 10 demonstrate the effect of varying the number of IU Ns on these factors.
Here, we also look at two different ROI sizes. The small region (R1) measures 3000 × 3000 square
meters, and the number of original beacon nodes (OBNs), nodes whose locations are known in
advance, is 1.5%, of the IU Ns (ie. 90 when the number of IU Ns is 6000). The number of IU Ns
that we experiment with in small regions is 6000, 7000, and 8000. This gives us a good idea of the
behaviour of the model as the number of IU Ns changes. The communication range of the nodes
in small regions that we experiment with are 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m.
Similarly, we conduct the experiments in extensive regions (R2) as well that measure 5000×5000
square meters. The number of OBNs here is also 1.5% of the number of IU Ns. The number of
IU Ns in these extensive regions varies between 10, 000 and 15, 000. The communication range of
the nodes in extensive regions is 75 m, and 100 m. As mentioned earlier, a communication range
of 50 m proves to be too small for large regions with nodes far apart.
The specific observations for each of the factors as the number of IU Ns varies is as follows:
— Average Localisation Error (A −LE): The A −LE does not vary sharply but does increase
gradually as the number of IU Ns increase, both in small and extensive regions. This is along
expected lines; a more significant number of IU Ns would compromise the localisation accu-
racy a little, given that the known OBNs do not increase much.
— Unknown Nodes Remaining (U NR): The number of nodes that remain unknown at the end
of the localisation process (U NR) falls sharply with an increase in the number of IU Ns. This
is interesting and is attributed to the fact that a larger number of IU N within a fixed size of
ROI leads to a higher density of IU Ns. In other words, the number of IU Ns within a unit area
of the ROI becomes more extensive and thus, the nodes are closely packed together. This
leads to a sharp reduction in the number of nodes that are not within the communication
range of known (already localised) nodes, and thus, very few are left out at the end as U BNs.

A Hybrid Approach for Localisation of Sensor Nodes in Remote Locations
23:21
— Number of Iterations (NITs): The number of iterations remains relatively stable for large
communication ranges like 75 m and 100 m. However, when the communication range is 50
m, there is a sharp fall in the NITs required to localise all nodes. This is because larger com-
munication ranges already facilitate communication between most neighbouring nodes and
do not benefit much from nodes being closely packed to each other (which is a consequence
of an increased number of IU Ns in the same sized ROI). Systems with small communication
ranges (like 50 m), however, significantly benefit from an increased number of IU Ns as
most nodes are more closely packed and most nodes fall within the communication range of
each other.
— Localisation Time (LT): The time required to localise the entire network, or the expected
localisation time, increases with a larger number of IU Ns and hence node density. This rise
is attributed to an increased number of computations required to localise a larger number
of nodes.
4.2.5
Effect of Varying Deployment Type. In this section, we explore the effect of the deploy-
ment strategy on various parameters characterising our localisation approach. Three localisation
strategies are studied: (1) Equidistant Deployment at the Boundary (EDB), where the original
beacon nodes (OBNs), nodes whose locations are known at the beginning, are deployed along
the peripheries of the region of interest and are at equal distance from each other; (2) Random
Deployment (RD), where the (OBNs) are deployed randomly across the ROI; and (3) Randomly
at the Boundary (RDB), where the OBNs are deployed at the periphery and randomly and not
necessarily equidistant from each other. EDB and RDB deployments are common as the ROIs
are usually inhospitable terrains, and establishing the location of a node in advance (using GPS
devices or other common means) is only possible at the periphery of the ROI. RD across the
ROI is less common, but in terrains like forests, there are random points that can be reached and
which have feeble GPS connectivity, and thus deployment of OBNs is possible. These deployment
strategies were chosen for a comprehensive study of all possibilities. Section 4.2.2 has nice
visualisations of the localisation process for these three deployments.
The experiments to study the effect of the deployment strategy were conducted over small (R1)
regions and extensive (R2) regions. In R1, there were 8000 IU Ns and the OBNs numbered 1% (or
80) of the IU Ns. For the larger R2 regions, the number of IU Ns was 15000, and OBNs were again
1% (or 150 in number) of the IU Ns. The communication range of the nodes in both regions was
fixed at 150 m. Figure 11 shows the changes in the characteristics of the localisation approach with
a change in the area of the network, the ROI.
— Average Localisation Error (A−LE): TheA−LE remains largely constant and has a small value
for the three deployment types as the size of the ROI increases. This is true for both small
and large deployment regions. This result reiterates our claim that the proposed approach
is an effective localisation tool irrespective of the type and size of the ROI.
— Unknown Nodes Remaining (U NR): TheU NR, the number of nodes that remain unlocalised
at the end of the localisation process, is near zero for relatively small ROIs, which is desirable.
As the ROI size increases for the same number of IU Ns (Initially Unlocalised Nodes), the
deployment density of the IU Ns drops and certain IU Ns end up quite far away from the
nearest known node. This results in such IU Ns getting missed and adds to the number of
U NRs. This leads to a sudden and rapid spike in the graph.
— Number of Iterations (NIT): The number of iterations (NITs) required to localise the entire
network uniformly increases as the size of the ROI increases. This is along expected lines as
the localisation process gradually moves from the peripheries to the centre (in the case of
EDB and RDB). In the case of RD, the NITs required are much smaller because the existence

of known beacon nodes (OBNs) across the ROI enables the convergence of the localisation
process from multiple points and thus requires much fewer iterations.
— Localisation Time (LT): The localisation time (LT) for similar reasons as NITs uniformly
increases with increase inROI. For random deployment, the localisation time is much smaller
as the localisation progresses from multiple points.

Effect of Varying Terrain. In this section, we endeavour to get insight into the efficacy
of the proposed localisation approach in various kinds of terrain. We investigate four distinct
terrains: free space (ENV 1), sandy terrain (ENV 2), grassy terrain (ENV 3), and terrain with sparse
trees (ENV 4). The results (Figure 12) were obtained through simulations with deployments over
both small regions (R1) and extensive regions (R2). In the R1 region, 8000 initial unknown nodes
(IU N) were deployed, with the number of OBNs being 1% of IU Ns i.e., 80 with a communication
range (CR) of 75 m. For the extensive R2 regions, the number of IU Ns was increased to 15, 000, and

the OBNs were again 1% or 150 in number, and the CR was 75 m. The observations were recorded
for all the terrain kinds described above:
— Average Localisation Error (A-LE): The localisation error rises as the amount of obstacles
(environmental noise) in the environment increases. The presence of environmental noise
makes it challenging for the RSSI method to calculate the distance accurately.
— Number of Iterations (NITs): As environmental noise increases, the signal strength decreases
(for instance, a signal that can communicate up to 75 m in free space may only reach 25 to
30 m in sparse trees). Consequently, the decrease in CR leads to an automatic increase in the
NITs required.
— Localisation Time (LT): The time taken to localise the network increases with the level of
environmental noise. When the NITs increase, the LT also increases.
— Unknown Nodes Remaining (U NR): The presence of obstacles significantly increases the
number of nodes that remain unknown (UNR) as environmental noise intensifies.
4.2.7
Effect of Accumulative Error. In this section, we explore the variation of accumulative
error in localisation as the process progresses through iterations. We conduct simulations for both
small (R1) and extensive (R2) regions. These comprise regions of size varying between 4000 × 4000
m2 and 7000 × 7000 m2; the number of OBNs is taken as 1% of the IU Ns with a communication
range (CR) of 100 m. The largest values for region size andCR are considered to best understand the
impact of accumulative error. The results (Figure 13) show that the accumulative error increases
with the progress of iteration but the rise is not very marked.
4.2.8
Node Localisability. In a WSN network, if the number of nodes for a fixed area is large,
i.e., the network is dense the network is easily localisable. However, a dense deployment is difficult
in larger areas such as those ranging in size between 1000 × 1000 m2 and 7000 × 7000 m2. For such
large areas, it is necessary to check the node localisability before moving forward with the actual
deployment. Doing this makes it possible to estimate the minimum number of nodes required to
cover the entire area, how many of the nodes can be localised, and which ones are such nodes (that
can be localised). To establish the network’s localisability, we find the minimum number of nodes
required to localise 95% of unknown nodes with the communication range (CR) of the WSN nodes
being 100m. We run simulations with the area of deployment varying between 1000×1000m2 and
7000×7000m2 for the three types of OBN deployment methods (Random (RD), Equidistant on the

The simulation results are computed for the environment E0 with no interference from outside
objects while keeping the OBN constant at 80 and 100 for R1 and R2 regions, respectively. The
OBNs are deliberately kept constant to facilitate better comprehension of the simulation results.
The results clearly show that the proposed method performs well for both regions with a high
percentage of node localisability.

Comparison with SOTA. In this section, we compare simulation results based on the
localisation accuracy of the proposed method with well-known methods like trilateration [47],
Angle of Arrival [23], and state-of-the-art machine learning-based methods [17] like neural
networks, random forest, and support vector regression. The received signal strength values are
used in the methods based on trilateration (TL), random forest (RF), neural networks (NN),
and support vector regression (SVR). For approaches utilising AoA, two angles from different
beacon nodes are used to localise an unknown node. An iterative approach is used to compute
the results. Table 9 shows the simulation parameters used for computing results for comparison
with state-of-the-art methods.

The experiments are performed by varying the parameters in Table 9. Unlike the proposed
method, the other five methods are hardly able to localise initial unknown nodes (IU N) in a setting
where the original beacon nodes (OBN) are only 1%, 1.5%, and 2.5% of the total number with a com-
munication range (CR) of 50 and 75 m. In these cases, the number of unknown nodes remaining
(U NR) is very large because these methods require at least two or more beacon nodes to localise
an unknown node. The results are compared based on four parameters: average localisation error,
average number of iterations, average unknown nodes remaining, and average localisation time
for both R1 and R2 regions. The results are evaluated for four different environments: free space
(E0), sandy terrain (E1), long grassy terrain (E2), and sparse tree terrain (E3).
4.2.9.1 Average Localisation Error. The average localisation error is an important parameter for
comparing localisation algorithms. In 2-D space, the parameter is computed as the Euclidean dis-
tance between the actual coordinates and the predicted coordinate values of the nodes to be lo-
calised. Tables 10, and 11 show the average localisation error for R1, and R2 regions, respectively.
The proposed method outperforms the five state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. For
the R1 region, 8000 IU Ns were deployed with 5% of these serving as OBNs with an CR of 100m.
As stated earlier, we are only able to compare with such a liberal number of OBNs because the ex-
isting methods were unable to make a mark with smaller numbers. Similarly, for R2 regions, 15000

IU Ns are deployed in different regions of various sizes, with the OBN constituting 5% of the total
nodes and with a CR of 100m. The proposed method performs better than existing state-of-the-art
methods for regions of all sizes and environments.
4.2.9.2 Average Number of Iterations. This parameter indicates the number of iterations required
to complete a network’s localisation process; the fewer the iterations, the better the algorithm. This
is critical in a real-world implementation because topological information such as the number of
known and unknown nodes change after every iteration, and maintaining this information is an
additional overhead (in terms of energy) on the network. It also helps in analysing the number of
nodes localised per iteration and is a measure of the localisability of the network.
Experiments were conducted with 8000 IU Ns of which 5% were OBN with a CR of 100m for
all four environments in regions falling in the category of R1 in terms of size. Similarly, for R2
regions, 15000 IU Ns were deployed with 5% of these being OBN with a CR of 100m for all four
environments. The experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed method outperforms
existing approaches in the terms of number of iterations. We do not include all the results here but
interested readers can access the same at the following URL.
4.2.9.3 Average Unknown Nodes Remaining. The Average Unknown Nodes Remaining is a param-
eter that indicates the average number of initially unknown nodes (IU N) that remain unlocalised
at the end of the localisation process. An IU N can remain unknown if the nodes are not within the
communication range of beacon nodes or are outliers in the network. If the number of unknown
nodes in a network is small, the algorithm works better. The network density is inversely propor-
tional to the number of unknown nodes remaining; here, the density implies the number of IU Ns
deployed throughout the network. The quantitative results for the average number of unknown
nodes remaining for R1 regions are computed by deploying 8000 IU Ns of which 5% are OBNs

with a CR of 100m. Similarly, for R2 regions the 15000 IU Ns are deployed with 5% of IU Ns being
OBNs with a CR of 100m. The results in both regions are computed on four different simulation
environments, affirming that the proposed method works better than the existing state-of-the-art
methods. Detailed quantitative results on this factor are available at the following URL.
4.2.9.4 Average Localisation Time. The average localisation time represents the time required to
localise all possible nodes in a region of a given size and a given number of nodes. Localisation
time is an important parameter that helps to determine the time approximately required to execute
the algorithm and localise nodes in challenging real-world applications like forest fire detection,
battlefield surveillance, and so on. The average localisation time is calculated by deploying 8000
IU Ns in regions of sizes varying between (1000 × 1000 and 4000 × 4000 m2) with 5% of the IU N
being OBN having a communication range of 100m. The other region experimented with has an
area between 5000×5000 and 7000×7000m2, with 15000 IU Ns and 5% of the IU N being OBN with
a CR of 100m. The proposed work is clearly seen to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods
in all settings. The detailed results are available at the following URL.
4.3
Real-world Prototypical Implementation
To assess the feasibility of the proposed localisation approach in a real-world outdoor environment
localisation, we made a simple prototypical implementation of a wireless sensor network in the
sports ground of our Institute. The deployment comprised two types of nodes: the nodes with
known locations to start with, called original beacon nodes (OBN), and the initially unknown
nodes (IU N). The OBN was configured using an Uno microcontroller [6], an XBee S2C (for
measuring the received signal strength) [34], a Neo 6M GPS module (for determining the location)
[33], a unipolar stepper motor [10], a laser light (mounted on the stepper motor for measuring
the angle of arrival of the signal) [13], and a 9-volt zinc-carbon battery. The IU N included an Uno
microcontroller, an XBee S2C, and a 9-volt zinc-carbon battery. The Xbees were configured using
the ZIGBEE TH Reg firmware and API 2 mode. The setup of the OBN and the IU N is shown
in Figure 14.
Two factors are computed for establishing the location of unknown nodes as per the proposed
approach: the distance between the unknown IU N and known OBN node and the angle of arrival
of a signal from theOBN to the IU N. Computing the distance is relatively straightforward through
direct mapping between the received signal strength and the distance. Computing the angle of
arrival of the signal is a little more involved. The norm for computing the angle of arrival has
been the use of antenna arrays. This approach, however, is limited to only a few unknown nodes,
owing largely to the use of signals vulnerable to interference and noise. To overcome these issues,
we have developed a simple yet novel technique for measuring the angle of arrival. This technique
involves mounting a laser light on the unipolar stepper motor of the OBN nodes. The stepper

motor by default rotates 360◦in 200 steps, with each step, therefore, covering 1.8◦(360/200). For
our deployment, however, we adjusted the step size of the stepper motor to 360, so that each
rotation step rotates the motor by 1◦. The stepper motor is aligned such that zero degrees coincide
with the North direction of the compass and rotates clockwise until the laser light shines on the
unknown node. At this point, the stepper motor is stopped, and the angle is measured by counting
the number of steps rotated. The technique is pictorially demonstrated in Figure 15, illustrating the
computing of the angle of arrival. We are working towards developing an automated mechanism
for stopping the stepper motor when the laser beam falls on the unknown node and measuring
the angle.
Our deployment comprised positioning the OBNs equidistant from each other at the periphery
of a 60 ∗38 square meter sports ground. The unknown IU N nodes were subsequently, randomly
deployed across the ground. Figure 16 provides a “bird’s eye view” of the setup used on the ground
using a drone camera.
Figure 17 shows the same set-up with the ROI divided into grids. The nodes circled in red rep-
resent the unknown IU Ns, while the known OBNs are circled in yellow. The points marked with
crosses (Pred points) indicate the locations computed using our proposed method.
The deployment comprised a total of 11 nodes, 7 IU Ns, 3 OBNs, and 1 base station. The actual
and computed positions of IU Ns are shown in Table 12. The average localisation error over the
prototypical deployment was 2.509 m, with the ROI being 60 × 38 m2 (i.e., 2280 m2).
In our simulation, the localisation error was around 1m, whereas in real-world deployments
the error went up to 2.5m. The stark difference in these values between simulations and the
real-world is due largely to the inaccuracies of low-cost range-based devices (whose precision is as
low as 2 m) and the environmental conditions (minor grassy terrains). As the localisation process
progresses through iterations, with the newly localised nodes serving as beacon nodes for subse-
quent iterations, the localisation error accumulates. It is difficult, in a real-world setting to scale
our deployment to measure the localisation error after a large number of iterations, but based on
our limited deployment we propose the expression in Equation (13) to calculate the accumulative
error.

Where DErr is the error due to the device; the exponent Iter denotes the number of iterations or,
in other words, the number of hops from the initial node to reach the unknown node; and LErr(i) is
the localisation error for iteration i. As the experiments are conducted over relatively small areas
with a much smaller number of beacons and unknown nodes as compared to the simulations, only
a limited understanding of the propagation of accumulative error in real-world environments is
possible. In addition to inaccuracies due to the devices, environmental factors also affect the ac-
curacy of localisation in real-world deployments. Generalised results obtained using the Equation
(13) could be beneficial in understanding the effect of accumulative error in harsh terrains like
flood and fire detection before actual deployment, where the deployment cost of devices is high.
It is important to note that the intention of the real-world deployment is not to assess the effec-
tiveness of the system in terms of localisation accuracy. The results are quite compromised owing
to the use of inexpensive and basic equipment that was easily accessible to us. Rather the intent
of the deployment is to demonstrate the feasibility of the system in a real-world environment.

Conclusion
This article proposed a novel technique for identifying the location of nodes in a WSN without
the need for GPS and using the coordinates of only one beacon node whose location is known in
advance. The technique proposed comprises the use of a hybrid combination of the AoA and RSSI
to identify the location of unknown nodes. This hybrid localisation approach permeates through
the entire region of interest, irrespective of its size, through an iterative approach. Here, the initial
beacon nodes localise unknown nodes, which in turn serve as beacon nodes in the subsequent iter-
ation. The uniqueness of our approach is that it is the first of its kind that only requires one beacon
node to localise an unknown node. This is made possible through the use of a combination of RSSI
and AoA. Furthermore, our approach overcomes the unrealistic assumption that all unknown
nodes are within the communication range of all beacon nodes to start with. This is made possible
through adopting an iterative approach to cover the entire region of interest. The effectiveness
of the proposed localisation approach was thoroughly validated through extensive simulation
studies. This was necessitated owing to the lack of access to a sufficiently large WSN deployment.
Subsequently, the real-world efficacy of the approach was validated through a prototypical
implementation.
