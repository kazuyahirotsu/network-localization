Abstract—We present results for outdoor ranging and 
positioning based on the Long-Range (LoRa) modulation, which 
is a widespread wireless IoT technology. LoRa systems typically 
operate in sub-GHz frequency bands with only 125 kHz 
bandwidth, which restricts the ranging performance due to the 
limited temporal resolution. The investigated LoRa ranging 
method operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band and 
supports wider bandwidths, achieving for outdoor ranging a 
mean distance error below 50 m over distances of up to 1400 m.  
Positioning based on LoRa ranging obtained a measured 
Distance Root Mean Square (DRMS) error of 30 m, which 
reduced to 5 m for tracking of a mobile node, making it a 
suitable method for approximate outdoor positioning and 
tracking of IoT devices without using Global Navigation 
Satellite Systems (GNSS).

INTRODUCTION 
The Long-Range (LoRa) modulation is based on Chirp 
Spread Spectrum (CSS) signals and has become popular for 
wide-area Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to the 
operation in unlicensed spectrum (typically 868 MHz in 
Europe and 915 MHz in North America), its energy efficiency 
and low cost [1]. Since IoT devices are typically energy 
constrained and price-sensitive, the localization of IoT devices 
cannot always rely on an additional Global Navigation 
Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver. Another reason for not 
relying on GNSS can also be that the line-of-sight (LOS) path 
to the satellites may be blocked. 
LoRa operating in the 868 MHz frequency band typically 
uses 125 kHz of bandwidth where Time-Difference-of-
Arrival (TDoA) methods have been shown to obtain median 
location errors of around 150 m [2]. As shown in section II.C, 
the temporal resolution of such a LoRa signal corresponds to 
a minimum separable difference in length of individual paths 
of 2400 m. In oder to obtain higher temporal resolution for 
time-of-flight (TOF) based ranging in multipath propagation 
environments the SX1280 LoRa transceiver is employed, 
which operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band and 
supports bandwidths of up to 1625 kHz. After a brief 
introduction to ranging with LoRa we present measurement 
results obtained for ranging as well as positioning and tracking 
in outdoor environments. The results based on practical 
measurements show that LoRa ranging can be used for 
determining approximate ranging distances or locations and 
for tracking of LoRa enabled IoT devices without the need for 
an additional GNSS receiver. 
 
Other common IoT wireless technologies operating in the 
2.4 GHz ISM frequency band are Bluetooth Low Energy 
(BLE) and Wi-Fi. While BLE with the direction finding 
functionality is well suited for short-range localization of 
nodes by triangulation, the coded-PHY long-range mode does 
not support direction finding [3]. Several localization methods 
using Wi-Fi exist, but its limited range precludes wide-area 
applications.  
Previous work on LoRa ranging in [4] provides a detailed 
performance comparison between LoRa ranging and Coherent 
Ranging On Narrowband Enabled Networks (CRONEN). 
LoRa ranging in the 2.4 GHz frequency band obtained a mean 
error of 75 m for LOS and 144 m for non-LOS environments 
for distances ≤ 500 m, while the mean error values were 
around 50 % lower with CRONEN. The investigation of the 
LoRa ranging capabilities in [5] presents additional ranging 
measurement results for different LoRa parameter settings. 
Compared to [4] and [5], our main contribution is that we 
extend the use of LoRa ranging to positioning and tracking. 
II. 
RANGING WITH LORA MODULATION 
A. Basics of LoRa Ranging 
LoRa uses 2SF possible cyclic time shifts of a CSS symbol 
for modulation, with one symbol carrying SF bits. The value 
SF is termed spreading factor, although its role is different 
from the one in traditional Code Division Multiple Access 
(CDMA) systems since the bandwidth BW can be chosen 
independently of the spreading factor [6]. The SX1280 
transceiver operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, 
where larger bandwidths are available than in the lower 
frequency bands, supporting the bandwidths BW = 406, 812 
and 1625 kHz and spreading factors SF = 5, 6, …, 10 for 
ranging. The highest RX sensitivity is -122 dBm, which is 
achieved with BW = 406 kHz and SF = 10 [7] and results in a 
maximum coupling loss of 134.5 dB when the TX power at its 
maximum value of 12.5 dBm. This corresponds up to a few 
kilometers coverage in a rural environment.

The ranging engine in the SX1280 PHY layer uses a two-
way ranging procedure for half-duplex systems described in 
section 6.1 of [8], which is based on TOF measurements and 
shown in Fig. 1, with ranging reference time-points defined at 
the end of the ranging messages. Compared to one-way-
ranging methods, the clocks in node A and node B do not have 
to be time synchronized, but clock oscillator offsets between 
the two nodes should be kept small. 
Upon reception of a ranging request message from node A 
containing the correct node B address, node B switches 
TD = 2∙Tsym seconds after the end of the ranging request from 
receive to transmit mode and sends a ranging response 
message to node A. The switching delay TD depends on the 
CSS symbol duration Tsym = 2SF/BW. 
By measuring the time TA, which is assumed to have been 
corrected for known delays additional to the propagation over-
the-air and which are determined during calibration, the 
propagation time TP and the ranging distance d can be 
obtained by node A as

where c is the propagation speed and TB is the overall response 
delay between ranging request reception and ranging response 
transmission at node B, which includes the switching delay TD 
and the duration of the ranging response configured to 15·Tsym. 
In section 6.1.3. of [8] it is shown that in such a system the 
error of the measured propagation time mainly depends on the 
relative oscillator offset δ =  (fB – fA) / f0 between the clock-
frequency of the node B fB and node A fA, with f0 being the 
nominal frequency. This results in the approximate ranging 
distance error

(2) 
Assuming δ = ±40 ppm (unlikely worst-case with the 
accuracy of the node A and node B clock each being ±20 
ppm), this results for the longest response delay TB = 42.9 ms 
obtained according to [7] for BW = 406 kHz and SF = 10 in a 
theoretical worst-case ranging distance error of Δdmax =  
257 m. With the parameters BW = 1625 kHz and SF = 5 the 
error is minimised and reduces to Δdmin = 2.01 m. Therefore, 
for long CSS symbol durations Tsym a correction of the relative 
clock offsets will be more beneficial. 
The relative oscillator offset δ can be obtained by 
measuring the carrier frequency offset, which however is only 
possible when transmitting standard (non-ranging) LoRa 
messages with the SX1280 transceiver. Instead, a back-to-
back ranging was implemented to minimise the impact of the 
relative oscillator offset, as described subsequently. 
B. Implementation of LoRa Ranging 
The implemented back-to-back ranging uses two two-way 
ranging procedures, where the roles of node A and node B are 
swapped during the second two-way ranging procedure 
according to section 6.1.3 in [8] and which is summarised in 
the message flow diagram in Fig. 2. Since the ranging distance 
errors Δd in (2) will have the same magnitude but opposite 
signs for the respective ranging procedures, the error due to 
Fig. 2. Implemented back-to-back ranging with LoRa modulation 
the relative oscillator offset can be eliminated by averaging 
the ranging distances obtained by the two individual 
measurements, assuming that there are no clock drifts during 
the measurement duration consisting of the back-to-back 
ranging procedure. 
We term the node starting the back-to-back ranging 
primary node and the other node secondary node. Additional 
management messaging using standard LoRa messages are 
introduced for starting the back-to-back ranging procedure by 
the primary node and for exchanging the result of the second 
two-way ranging procedure between secondary and primary 
node. 
For the measurements we developed our own hardware 
platform based on the Semtech SX1280 transceiver and an 
STM32 processor. The hardware includes a GPS receiver 
module for determining the ground truth position and an SD-
card for storing measurements used for subsequent offline 
processing and analysis. 
C. Sources of Error 
Apart from the already considered relative oscillator offset 
error in (2), additional sources of error are discussed next. The 
temporal resolution capability of multipath components will 
limit the accuracy of the measured ranging distance in a 
multipath environment, since the best estimate for a ranging 
distance is the direct LOS path length. The multipath 
resolution capability, expressed as the difference in length of 
individual paths is according to section 2.1.3 in [8] 
approximately

Considering the available bandwidths with the SX1280 
transceiver this results in the multipath resolutions listed in 
TABLE I. The bandwidth BW = 125 kHz is typically used 
with LoRa in the 868 MHz frequency band and is included for 
comparison with the wider bandwidths available in the 
2.4 GHz ISM frequency band. Since in the best-case multipath 
components require at least 185 m difference in length to be 
fully separable, we expect this limitation to dominate the 
overall ranging distance error.

The multipath resolution was tested in the lab with two 
LoRa nodes performing ranging measurements over a channel 
simulator (Elektrobit Propsim F32) with two configured paths. 
The LOS path measured 1800 m and the second path was 
750 m longer and had 3 dB less power. This difference in path 
length is close to the theoretical multipath resolution for the 
LoRa bandwidth of 406 kHz in TABLE I. The measured 
ranging distances for the different bandwidths listed in 
TABLE II. show that the smallest bandwidth of 406 kHz is 
indeed not able to fully separate the paths and obtains a 
ranging distance of 1900 m, while the larger bandwidths 
obtain values much closer to the true LOS path distance of 
1800 m being simulated.

Another source of error are additional delays in the 
implementation and the hardware (e.g. filters), where the 
hardware delays are frequency and bandwidth dependent. 
These can be determined and corrected using a calibration 
procedure described in section D. 
Finally, noise in the received signal causes ranging 
distance errors. The resulting theoretical lower bound of the 
standard deviation of the ranging distance σd is given by the 
Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) in section 6.1 in [9], 
which, after division by 
2  to account for the averaging of the 
two two-way ranging measurements used in back-to-back 
ranging, is

with N the configurable number of CSS symbols used in the 
ranging data. Based on (4) the largest standard deviation 
d
σ
=  
1.26 m is obtained with BW = 403 kHz and SF = 5, assuming 
a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of SNR = 12.5 dB and N = 15. 
Thus, the expected error due to noise is far smaller than the 
limited multipath resolution in TABLE I.  
D. Calibration 
To remove fixed additional delays in the implementation, 
the system was calibrated using RF transmission over a 
coaxial cable of 75 m electrical length with one node placed 
in an RF shielding box to avoid coupling over the air between 
the two nodes. With this setup the offset-values for all BW and 
SF combinations were measured at 1 MHz frequency steps 
with 100 measurements per parameter combination. These 
offset-values, in the range of several hundred meters, were 
then stored for correction of the ranging measurements. While 
performing calibration measurements the standard deviation 
was determined as 
d
σ
=  2.11 m for BW = 403 kHz, SF = 5, 
SNR = 12.5 dB and N = 15, which is 67 % higher than the 
theoretical lower bound given by (4). 
Calibration can also remove the relative oscillator offsets 
between the two nodes in (2), but only if they do not change 
over time, e.g. due to temperature variations. 
III. 
RANGING MEASUREMENTS 
Ranging measurements were conducted with our SX1280 
based hardware between two calibrated nodes in a flat, rural 
environment. The primary node had a fixed location with 
antenna height of 1.5 m above ground, while the secondary 
node was carried by a person and was mounted on a short mast 
with an antenna height of 2 m above ground to avoid 
obstruction of the antenna by the person. Both antennas were 
omni-directional. The secondary node covered a route of 8.2 
km length at walking speed with distances of up to 1400 m 
between the two nodes, using the LoRa parameters BW = 
400 kHz and SF = 8 and performing around 25000 ranging 
measurements on the whole route. The smallest bandwidth 
was used to obtain a robust link-budget while SF = 8  resulted 
in slightly lower standard deviations 
d
σ than higher values of 
SF during calibration measurements in the laboratory for 
BW = 400 kHz. The ground truth distance was determined 
from logged GPS coordinates. 
Fig. 3. Ranging test with ground truth route (orange crosses) and estimated 
ranging distances (blue crosses) marked on a radially extending line between 
the position of the fixed node (red square) and the ground truth position. 
Map: swisstopo 
Fig. 3 shows the estimated ranging distances marked with 
blue crosses on a radially extending line between the position 
of the fixed node at the red square and the ground truth 
position of the mobile node. Compared to the ground truth 
route marked with orange crosses, it can be observed that in 
general the measured ranging distance over-estimates the true 
distance. 
As can be observed from Fig. 4, the standard deviation of 
the distance error tends to increase with larger distances. We 
found that the increase in standard deviation correlates well 
with lower SNRs, as shown in Fig. 5, which shows the 
standard deviation of the distance error per SNR bin. A 
reduction in SNR is generally expected as the distance 
increases and the increase in standard deviation is therefore in

line with the CRLB expression in (4). The outlier at 250 m 
distance was caused by a tree alley in that area, which resulted 
in shadowing and therefore a more multipath-dominated 
propagation. The standard deviation of the distance error over 
the whole route was 83.6 m. 
The multipath propagation in the test area and the limited 
multipath resolution are thought to have led to the observed

distance bin 
Fig. 5. Measured standard deviation of the ranging distance error per SNR 
bin 
over-estimation of the ranging distance (i.e. positive mean 
distance error) for all distance bins, as shown in Fig. 6. The 
mean distance error tends to increase with larger distances, 
which could be explained with the LOS path becoming more 
blocked by obstacles as the distance increases. Again, an 
outlier at 250 m distance can be observed, which corresponds 
to the above-mentioned tree alley with increased multipath 
propagation. The maximum mean distance error was 91 m at 
950 m distance in an area of low received signal strength due 
to shadowing by a forest, corresponding to a relative error of 
9.6 %. The mean distance error over the whole route was 
46.4 m. 
Fig. 6. Measured mean ranging distance error per distance bin 
To reduce the mean ranging distance error, the following 
simple correction was derived using linear regression based 
on the measured ranging data.  The corrected ranging distance 
dc, given a measured ranging distance 20 m ≤ d ≤ 1400 m, is

(5) 
This correction extends the one proposed in section 8 in 
[9], which is valid for ranging distances d < 20 m. By applying 
(5) to the measured ranging distances, the mean distance error 
over the whole route could be reduced to < 10 m. 
Assuming that most practical applications will operate in 
a multipath environment and thus overestimate ranging 
distances, using a correction which is adapted to the specific 
environment is expected to be beneficial in most cases.  
Further measurements were carried out in a suburban 
environment on a route of 2.5 km length and with distances of 
up to 500 m between the two nodes using the same LoRa 
parameter configuration. The resulting standard deviation of 
the distance error was 45 m and a mean distance error was 
39 m over the whole route. The mean distance error was 
almost the same as in the rural environment, where the 
maximum distance between the two nodes were almost three 
times larger. This worse performance in the suburban 
environment may be attributed to the more multipath-
dominated propagation. 
IV. POSITIONING BASED ON RANGING 
Based on LoRa ranging, we implemented a positioning 
method for coordinates in two dimensions. Using K fixed 
reference nodes with the known coordinates of node i being 
(xi, yi), the unknown position of a mobile node with 
coordinates (x, y) is first estimated as the least-squares solution 
to the set of equations for all ranging distances di between the 
reference nodes i=1, 2, …, K and the mobile node

POSITIONING MEASUREMENTS 
The positioning method and tracking was evaluated with 
outdoor tests in a flat, rural environment using K = 4 fixed 
reference nodes located in the edges of a quadrangular area 
measuring about 400 m x 130 m.  The LoRa parameters were 
BW = 400 kHz and SF = 8. All ranging distances d1, d2, …, dK 
and the estimated position pn of the mobile node are updated 
once per second, with Δt = 1 s. Omni-directional antennas at 
a height of 1.5 m for the reference nodes and 2 m for the 
handheld mobile node were used with our SX1280 based 
hardware. To increase the accuracy of the estimated position, 
the measured ranging distances were first corrected using (5). 
Fig. 7. Positioning Test with estimated positions using LoRa ranging 
directly (yellow crosses) and tracking with Kalman filtering (blue line). The 
orange circles indicate the reference nodes. Aerial view: swisstopo 
Fig. 7 shows the test area with the 4 reference nodes 
marked with orange circles, the estimated positions of the 
mobile node directly obtained from LoRa ranging in (7) 
marked with yellow crosses and the estimated tracking using 
the additional Kalman filter in (10) marked with an 
interpolated blue line.  The true route of the mobile node 
carried by a person started at the red square, followed the path 
to the red triangle and returned to the red square. Based on the 
geometry of the setup, the highest Dilution of Precision (DOP) 
can be expected at the start and return-points. 
Positioning using the LoRa ranging measurements directly 
according to (7) resulted in a Distance Root Mean Square 
(DRMS) error of around 30 m, while the use of the Kalman 
filter in (10) for tracking reduced the DRMS error to around 
5 m. 
It should be noted that these measurements were 
performed in an environment with a dominant LOS path, the 
accuracy is expected to be worse in an environment with 
obstacles between the nodes. Improvements would be possible 
by using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor 
additionally to the LoRa ranging measurements to estimate the 
position of a mobile node. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
As expected, the LoRa ranging measurements in the 2.4 
GHz ISM frequency band were impacted by the limited 
multipath resolution capability, resulting in an over-
estimation of the ranging distances. This was observed over 
all distances in the outdoor measurements performed in a rural 
and a suburban environment. The variance and the mean of 
the ranging distance error both increased with higher distances 
due to a reduction in SNR and a likely increase in multipath 
propagation. Despite this, with a measured mean distance 
error of 46.4 m over true distances of up to 1400 m in a rural 
environment, the LoRa modulation is considered suitable for 
determining approximate distances. Further improvements are 
possible using corrections specific for the propagation 
environment to reduce the over-estimation of the ranging 
distance. 
Positioning based on LoRa ranging obtained a DRMS of 
around 30 m for a mobile node in a rural outdoor area 
measuring about 400 m x 130 m, which allows approximate 
positioning without the use of GNSS. Tracking of the mobile 
node using Kalman filtering reduced the DRMS to around 
5 m. Further improvements would be possible for a mobile 
node by combining the estimated position with measurements 
from an IMU sensor. Compared to GNSS, positioning with 
LoRa however relies on the deployment of additional 
infrastructure in the form of reference nodes. 
While the measurements were performed with the 
Semtech SX1280 transceiver with built-in ranging engine, the 
trends and conclusions are also applicable to other LoRa 
devices operating in the 2.4 GHz band using comparable 
bandwidths.
