Abstract
Indoor localization is the process of determining the location of a person or object inside a building.
Potential usage of indoor localization includes navigation, personalization, safety and security, and asset
tracking.
Some of the commonly used technologies for indoor localization include WiFi, Bluetooth,
RFID, and Ultra-wideband.
Out of these, WiFi’s Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based
localization is preferred because WiFi Access Points (APs) are widely available and do not require
additional infrastructure or hardware to be installed.
We have two main contributions. First, we develop our method, ’IndoorGNN’. This method involves
using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based algorithm in a supervised manner to classify a specific
location into a particular region based on the RSSI values collected at that location.
Most of the ML algorithms that perform this classification require a large number of labeled data
points (RSSI vectors with location information). Collecting such data points is a labor-intensive and time-
consuming task. To overcome this challenge, as our second contribution, we demonstrate the performance
of IndoorGNN on the restricted dataset.
It shows a comparable prediction accuracy to that of the
complete dataset. We performed experiments on the UJIIndoorLoc and MNAV datasets, which are real-
world standard indoor localization datasets. Our experiments show that IndoorGNN gives better location
prediction accuracies when compared with state-of-the-art existing conventional as well as GNN-based
methods for this same task. It continues to outperform these algorithms even with restricted datasets.
It is noteworthy that its performance does not decrease a lot with a decrease in the number of available
data points.
Our method can be utilized for navigation and wayfinding in complex indoor environments, asset
tracking and building management, enhancing mobile applications with location-based services, and
improving safety and security during emergencies. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.niser.ac.

Introduction
The process of determining the location of a person or a device in a given datum is called localization.
When localization is done within an indoor environment, it is called Indoor Localization. Potential usage of
indoor localization includes navigation[26, 9], asset tracking[17], safety and security[8], personalization[21],
healthcare [10, 29], and analytics[21]. For outdoor localization, satellite-based navigation system like GPS
(Global Positioning System) is commonly used because of their good performance.
But when it comes
to indoor localization, GPS doesn’t perform well as indoor environments consist of obstacles like walls,
floors, ceilings, and other materials that can block the satellite signals[7]. Also, the GPS receiver needs to
receive signals from at least four satellites to find the location accurately, which becomes harder in indoor
environments.
One example of an indoor environment where GPS fails is a large shopping mall or department store.
These indoor spaces typically have multiple floors, complex layouts, and dense structures such as walls

Figure 1: Illustratration of the regions within a shopping mall and the RSSI vector at a specific point
and ceilings. GPS signals from satellites struggle to penetrate through these obstacles, leading to weak
or no signal reception indoors. As a result, traditional GPS-based positioning methods become unreliable
or completely ineffective. In such cases, an alternative indoor positioning system is necessary to provide
accurate location information.
To tackle the problem of indoor localization, various technologies like Bluetooth[31, 3, 15], RFID[36,
32], Ultra-wideband[6, 28], and WiFi[37, 11] are explored.
Out of these technologies, WiFi RSSI-based
indoor localization is preferred[2] because WiFi access points are generally available in most buildings,
and smartphone has WiFi modules that can be used as a receiver, so it does not require any additional
infrastructure or hardware to be installed. However, indoor localization using WiFi RSSI fingerprint requires
a large amount of labeled data to train a Machine Learning model[25]. Getting the labeled data which
consists of an RSSI vector at a point and the location information of that point, is a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task.
Figure 1 depicts the creation of various regions inside shopping malls for indoor localization, enabling
a range of applications.
These include targeted advertising and promotions, where retailers can deliver
personalized advertisements and offers based on shoppers’ proximity to specific stores or product categories.
Location-based services enhance the shopping experience by providing notifications about nearby deals,
discounts, or events.
Indoor localization also facilitates crowd management, allowing mall operators to
monitor and manage crowd flow and congestion in real-time. Additionally, the use of indoor localization
data provides valuable insights into shopper behavior, footfall patterns, and popular areas within the mall,
enabling informed decisions on store placement, product positioning, and overall mall design to optimize
customer satisfaction and revenue generation.
In this paper, we present an approach for label/region prediction by leveraging the power of Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). Our proposed model, named IndoorGNN, utilizes a GNN-based methodology that
2
constructs a graph representation where each node corresponds to a specific RSSI vector. The edge weights
in the graph are determined by the similarity between the RSSI vectors.
To evaluate the effectiveness
of our approach, we conducted experiments using two widely recognized datasets: UJIIndoorLoc[33] and
MNAV[4]. These datasets are extensively employed in the domain of indoor localization and serve as stan-
dard benchmarks for comparing the performance of various models. The experimental results demonstrate
that IndoorGNN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as Graph Neural Network (GNN) based mod-
els where APs are considered nodes[18], k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, even when trained on a reduced
fraction of the dataset, IndoorGNN consistently maintains its superior performance over other algorithms.
The contributions of our research can be summarized as follows:
• Development and detailed model description: We introduce IndoorGNN, a novel model for accurate
label prediction in indoor localization. We provide a comprehensive description of its architecture and
key components, enabling a deeper understanding and facilitating its implementation in future research
and practical applications.
• Evaluation of IndoorGNN: We conduct a thorough evaluation of the performance of IndoorGNN in
accurate label prediction tasks for indoor localization.
This assessment allows us to measure the
effectiveness and efficiency of the model in solving real-world problems.
• Effectiveness of IndoorGNN: Our experimental results indicate the better performance of IndoorGNN
in comparison to existing algorithms. We observe this effectiveness across both complete and partial
training datasets, highlighting the robustness and versatility of IndoorGNN across different scenarios
and dataset sizes.
Our paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the related works that have been
conducted to enhance ML-based indoor localization systems. We review the existing literature and highlight
the advancements made in this field. In Section 3, we present a mathematical definition of the problem and
formulate it as a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based model. We outline the key components and outline
how GNN can effectively address the challenges associated with indoor localization. Section 4 details the
methodology behind our GNN-based model for indoor localization. We provide a step-by-step explanation
of our approach, including the construction of the graph representation with RSSI vectors as nodes and
the utilization of edge weights derived from vector similarity. Moving forward, in Section 5, we describe
the experimental setup employed in this study. We discuss the dataset used for evaluation and provide
a thorough explanation of how we approached solving the problems identified in Section 3. This section
highlights the experimental methodology with the results and enables readers to understand the practical
aspects of our research.

Related works
The propagation of an electromagnetic signal adheres to the inverse square law, but the presence of obstacles
obstructs the signal path, making it challenging to formulate the decrease in signal strength as an inverse
square law. To address this challenge, various Machine Learning algorithms have been explored to model
signal decay and generate RSSI fingerprints for predicting the location of new RSSI vectors. Commonly used
algorithms for indoor positioning include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [12, 34], Decision Trees [27], Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) [24, 5], and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) [23, 1, 20, 16]. Among these, kNN,
SVM, and Neural Network models have exhibited superior performance [30]. However, these models do not
consider the geometric characteristics of the indoor localization problem.
In recent years, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based models have emerged as a promising approach for
indoor localization. In the paper [38], a novel approach utilizing heterogeneous graphs based on the RSSI
between Access Points (APs) and waypoints was proposed to comprehensively represent the topological
structure of the data. Another paper [22] discussed the limitations of traditional ML algorithms in effec-
tively encoding fingerprint data and proposed a novel localization model based on a GraphSAGE estimator.
Moreover, [18] introduced a GNN-based model that leverages the geometry of the Access Points for WiFi
RSSI-based indoor localization. Further in [19] authors handle the problem of indoor localization with GNN
3
where they consider the APs as nodes and edges between them are decided by the received power between
them and they perform the experiments with both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.
However, one of the inherent challenges in indoor localization is the fluctuation of signal strength in WiFi
RSSI data. The varying signal strengths make it difficult to accurately determine the location of a user
or object in an indoor environment. To mitigate the impact of signal strength fluctuations, we introduce a
graph-based fingerprinting method for indoor localization. Our approach focuses on the stability of proximity
patterns in RSSI data rather than relying solely on individual AP RSSI values. By leveraging these stable
patterns, our method enhances the accuracy and reliability of indoor localization, providing a robust solution
for overcoming the challenges associated with fluctuating signal strengths in indoor environments.

Problem Statement
3.1
Preliminaries
A graph G = (V, E) consists of a set of vertices V and a set of edges E. The edge set is given as E =
{(i, j) | i, j ∈V }. The feature vectors corresponding to edge (i, j) is represented as eij. The neighborhood
of a node i is represented as N(i), such that N(i) = {j | (i, j) ∈E}. A node i’s representation in lth GNN
layer is given by x(l)
i .
3.2
Problem Definition
Let F ∈Rn×m be the feature matrix with n data points, each with an RSSI vector of size m, where Fi,j
represents the signal strength of j th access point in the ith data point. Let L ∈Tn be the matrix of labels
for the prediction task, where Li represents the region of the ith data point and T be the set of regions
for classification. We define a training mask M, for the data points in the training set with M ∈{0, 1}n
which represents the availability of data point for training, where Fi is available for training only if Mi = 1.
Let us define train ratio r as r = 1
n
P
i Mi which represents the ratio of the training data points available
for training the model. The problem that we address here is the classification of a given Fi into one of the
region ∈T.

Methodology
To categorize the positions into distinct regions using RSSI values, we employ a technique called Dynam-
icEdgeConv. The initial step involves structuring the data into a graph format using the k-Nearest Neighbors
(kNN) algorithm. This approach is chosen because it effectively captures the local spatial relationships within
the data, which are crucial for indoor localization. In essence, each data point (representing an RSSI mea-
surement) is considered as a node in the graph, and edges are formed between nodes based on their proximity,
determined by the kNN algorithm. This results in a graph where nodes represent data points, and edges
signify the spatial relationships between them.
The DynamicEdgeConv method introduces a dynamic graph generation process within the layers of the
Graph Neural Network. Rather than using a fixed, predefined graph structure, a new graph is generated at
each layer of the GNN based on the kNN approach. This dynamic graph generation strategy allows the GNN
to adapt and capture different levels of spatial information as it progresses through its layers. It essentially
incorporates local spatial relationships into the learning process, enabling the model to effectively exploit the
inherent structure and dependencies within the RSSI data. This adaptability is a critical factor in the success
of the IndoorGNN model, as it ensures that the model can learn and generalize effectively in diverse indoor
environments, where the spatial characteristics may vary significantly. In the subsequent section, we will
provide a more in-depth and comprehensive description of the DynamicEdgeConv methodology, including
its mathematical foundations and practical implementation details.

Modeling Data as Graph
We address the problem of indoor localization by modeling it as a graph-based problem. Specifically, we
translate this problem to a problem where we can make use of Dynamic Edge Convolution (DynamicEdge-
Conv) [35].
Every data point with a feature vector containing the RSSI values of dimension m collected at the
particular location and the location information is treated as a point in a space Rm. We assume that these
RSSI values lead us to determine the location of the data point. The corresponding location information of
the data points is the local region to which the data point belongs.
A directed graph G = (V, E) is constructed as a k-Nearest Neighbor graph of F in Rm. We also include
self-loops to the graph so that the point contributes to its next layer representation in a GNN. Hence every
point with an RSSI value is modeled as a node in the graph G, and the edges are constructed based on
k-NN.
4.2
Graph Neural Network for Prediction
The RSSI values act as the node features. The edge features are constructed using a learnable function
hΘ where Θ is the set of learnable parameters. The edge features are given as eij = hΘ(xi, xj), and the
learnable function hΘ : Rm × Rm →Rm′.
We perform edge convolution operations to compute the next layer representation of a node. The edge
convolution in an intermediate operation while computing node representations [13]. This operation is given
as follows:
x′
i = Aggregate {hΘ(xi, xj)j ∈N(i)}
(1)
where x′
i is the next layer representation of the node i, N(i) = {j : (i, j) ∈E} is the set of neighbors of i.
The aggregation function Aggregate is RSSI value-wise symmetric.
Figure 2 shows how edge convolution takes place given the features of the node and its neighborhood.
As an intermediate step, edge features are computed using the features of two nodes connected by the edges.
With these edge features, a new representation is generated for the node. Figure 3 shows in detail how the
edge features are computed given the features of the two nodes connected by the edge.
In Edge Convolution, we determine the edges using k-NN. In the DynamicEdgeConvolution, the graph is
recomputed at every layer based on the node representations (features) generated at every layer of the GNN.
Hence at every layer l, a new graph G(l) = (V(l), E(l)). The GNN is applied on this dynamically computed
graph, with the newly generated features at the particular layer.

Experimental Setup
5.1.1
Dataset
To evaluate the performance of our model compared to the baseline models, we conducted experiments using
the UJIIndoorLoc[33] and MNAV[4] datasets.
The UJIIndoorLoc dataset contains information about WiFi signal strengths used for testing indoor
positioning systems. It covers three buildings at Universitat Jaume I, each with four or more floors and a
total area of about 110 square meters. The dataset includes 19,937 training data points and 1,111 test data
points, with a total of 529 attributes. These attributes provide details such as WiFi signal readings, latitude,
longitude, and other helpful information. In the dataset, 520 Access Points (APs) were detected, and their
signal strengths, known as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), are given in the first 520 attributes.
The RSSI values range from -104dBm (weak signal) to 0dBm (strong signal), while a value of 100 means
that the access point was not detected. This dataset is publicly available on the UCI Website1.
The MNAV dataset was created for the Museo Nacional de Artes Visuales (MNAV, National Museum
of Visual Arts) in Uruguay as part of the project described in paper [4], which aimed to develop an indoor
localization system utilizing WiFi fingerprinting. This dataset is publicly accessible on GitHub2. It comprises
a total of 10,469 data points recorded during the data collection, with the detection of 188 Access Points
(APs). The paper also provides a museum map that delineates the locations of the APs and defines 16 regions
for the classification task. Among the 188 detected APs, 15 were installed specifically for the experiment,
with each AP supporting both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bandwidths. Consequently, the dataset encompasses
30 features derived from these APs. Here the RSSI values range from -99dBm (weak signal) to 0dBm (strong
signal), while a value of 0.0 means that the access point was not detected. Table 1 summarizes the details
of both datasets.
To preprocess the datasets, we made certain modifications. In both datasets, we added 104 to the RSSI
feature, thereby adjusting the range to 0-104. Additionally, we replaced the missing access point values i.e.
AP with an RSSI value of 100 in the UJIIndoorLoc dataset and AP with 0.0 RSSI value in the MNAV dataset,
to 0. In the MNAV dataset, the set of labels (regions) T was pre-defined within the dataset, consisting of a
total of 16 unique regions (classes). On the other hand, for the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, we generated the set
T by combining the FLOOR and BUILDINGID columns of the dataset. This process yielded a total of 13
unique regions (classes).
For the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, we utilized the predefined train and test split. As for the MNAV dataset,
there is no predefined train and test split, so we created a new train and test split with an 80:20 ratio. This
resulted in 8,375 training data points and 2,094 test data points out of the total 10,469 data points available.

We have used this training and test set for all of our experiments, and all the accuracy results presented
in this paper are on the test set. Our goal here is to improve the accuracy of label (region) prediction.
As getting labeled datasets is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task so to study the effect of using a
restricted dataset for training, we have performed the experiments for train ratio r ∈{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}.
The flowchart in Figure 4 visually summarizes the sequence of tasks involved in our study.
5.1.2
Models Description
In the case of MLP, we trained a neural network on the given training data set and then assessed the
performance on the test set, and the outcome derived from this was reported.
For kNN, a grid search approach was adopted to ascertain the ideal value for k. Following this determi-
nation, an evaluation of its performance was conducted using the test set. Notably, we observed that as the
size of the training data reduced, the optimal k value also decreased for the task.
In SVM, we utilized the Radial Basis Function (RBF) as the kernel function, which exhibited superior
performance compared to other kernel functions such as linear. Additionally, we conducted a grid search
to identify the optimal value for the parameter C, which balances the misclassification of training examples
against the simplicity of the decision surface.
For our GNN-based baselines, we analyze GNN[18]. This paper employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
with APs as nodes and the distance between them as edges of the graph for indoor localization and encom-
passes experimental evaluations on the UJIIndoorLoc and MNAV datasets. Consequently, we use the authors’
code to run on our preprocessed datasets.
In IndoorGNN, we employed two graph neural network layers as discussed in section 4.2 followed by a
fully connected neural network. The complete architecture of the model is shown in figure 5. In the GNN
layers, we utilized the mean function as the aggregator function in equation 1 when doing Edge Convolution
to aggregate values from the neighboring nodes, as it demonstrated better performance compared to other
aggregator functions such as max and sum.

Experimetal Results
Table 2 presents a comprehensive overview of algorithm performance on the complete datasets, including
their classification accuracy. Notably, our proposed IndoorGNN algorithm consistently outperforms both
conventional and GNN-based algorithms.
For the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, the preceding GNN model achieved a maximum classification accuracy of
91.3%. Among all other algorithms, SVM demonstrated the best performance with an accuracy of 94.5%.
In contrast, our IndoorGNN algorithm stood out with the highest classification accuracy of 95.8%.
Similarly, when considering the MNAV dataset, the GNN model achieved a classification accuracy of
96.3%.
Among the other algorithms, kNN exhibited the best performance with an accuracy of 97.5%.
Remarkably, our IndoorGNN algorithm also achieved a classification accuracy of 97.5%, surpassing the
performance of the GNN model and equalling that of the top-performing model, kNN.

Figure 6b presents a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset,
considering varying training dataset sizes. Notably, IndoorGNN consistently outperforms all other algo-
rithms, maintaining its superior performance even with reduced training data. Likewise, Figure 6a showcases
the performance analysis of diverse algorithms on the MNAV dataset, across different training dataset sizes.
Evidently, IndoorGNN either matches or surpasses the performance of other algorithms when trained on a
fraction of the dataset.
Figure 6 further emphasizes these observations. For the MNAV dataset, besides IndoorGNN, kNN and
GNN also exhibit strong performance. Conversely, on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, SVM demonstrates superior
performance, second only to IndoorGNN. It’s worth noting that IndoorGNN consistently outperforms all
others on both datasets, highlighting its ability to generalize across diverse data scenarios.
Analyzing the results depicted in Figure 6, an intriguing pattern emerges regarding algorithm performance
on the UJIIndoorLoc and MNAV datasets. Specifically, for the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, even as the training
data points decrease, algorithm performance remains relatively stable. This phenomenon can be attributed
to the presence of fixed points within the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, where multiple RSSI data measurements
have been recorded. Consequently, the algorithms maintain their performance because removing a specific
data point at a given location doesn’t result in significant information loss, given the availability of other
data points representing the same RSSI vector at that location.
In contrast, the MNAV dataset consists primarily of unique locations within the sampled area. Conse-
quently, algorithm performance is more reliant on the complete dataset. As the number of training data
points decreases, algorithm performance also diminishes accordingly.
In summary, these findings underscore the significant impact of dataset characteristics on algorithm
performance. The presence of multiple measurements at fixed points in the UJIIndoorLoc dataset allows for
robust performance even with reduced training data. In contrast, the unique location representation of most
data points in the MNAV dataset necessitates a larger training dataset for optimal algorithm performance,
with performance decreasing as training data diminishes.

challenging scenarios underscores its potential for real-world applications that demand both efficiency and
precision.
Looking ahead, our future research will explore several exciting avenues:
• Investigating methods for precise latitude and longitude location determination.
• Tackling scenarios with limited labeled data but an abundance of unlabeled data.
• Developing strategies to effectively handle missing RSSI values.
• Investigating localization methods in private settings using Graph Neural Networks [14].
These endeavors will further enhance the capabilities of IndoorGNN and extend its applicability in the
field of indoor localization.
