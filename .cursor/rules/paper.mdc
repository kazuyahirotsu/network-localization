# =========================
# Cursor Rules — IEEE Access Paper
# =========================
# Purpose
# - Help me write, revise, and finalize a high-quality IEEE Access manuscript.
# - Draft lives in: paper/paper.txt
# - Final LaTeX lives in: paper/paper.latex
# - Figures/images live in: paper/images
# - Sample code (for listings, algorithm details, and reproducibility) lives in: paper/sample_code
# - You (Cursor) should proactively suggest structure, tighten language, and enforce IEEE Access conventions.

# Canonical Sources (do not hallucinate)
- When describing methods, ablations, hyperparameters, or results, FIRST look in:
  1) paper/paper.txt (current draft)
  2) paper/sample_code/**/* (source of truth for implementations)
  3) paper/images/**/* (only use figures that exist here)
- If information is missing, ask for the minimal facts needed or propose clearly labeled TODOs.

# Deliverables & Workflow
- Author in paper/paper.txt using plain text with lightweight markers (see below).
- Keep paper/paper.latex as the single LaTeX output (no extra .tex files unless I ask).
- Maintain a clean, minimal diff when editing.
- Never break existing figure paths or labels. If you rename a figure, update its \label and all \ref.
- Prefer incremental passes:
  1) Outline, 2) Fill content, 3) Evidence & citations, 4) Tighten style, 5) Figure/table polish, 6) Final LaTeX conversion.

# IEEE Access Structure (default)
- Title, Authors, Affiliations, Corresponding author
- Abstract (150–250 words; problem → method → key results → significance)
- Index Terms (3–8, comma-separated; standardized terms)
- I. Introduction (motivation, gap, contributions as bullet list)
- II. Related Work (organized by themes; synthesize, do not list)
- III. Method (clear assumptions, notation, algorithm steps, complexity)
- IV. Experiments (datasets, metrics, baselines, implementation details, ablations)
- V. Results & Discussion (quantitative tables/figures + analysis; limitations)
- VI. Conclusion & Future Work
- Acknowledgment (if any)
- References (BibTeX)
- (Optional) Appendix, Nomenclature

# Writing Style Guardrails
- Audience: expert but time-constrained reviewers.
- Be precise, concise, and falsifiable. Prefer short sentences. Avoid hype.
- Use active voice where possible. Avoid first-person plural unless needed for clarity.
- Define symbols on first use; keep a running notation table if needed.
- One claim → one piece of evidence (number, table, or citation).
- NO purple prose. No vague superlatives (e.g., “state-of-the-art”) without citation and numbers.
- Avoid using ; and past tense

# Citations & References
- Use BibTeX; cite as \cite{key}. Do not inline raw URLs.
- Tie every factual comparison or borrowed idea to a citation.
- For “SOTA” claims, include year, venue, and metric with numeric comparisons.
- Prefer stable sources (journals/conferences with DOIs) over blogs.
- If a citation is missing, insert: [CITATION NEEDED: <1-line description>] and add a TODO.

# Figures, Tables, and Captions
- Place all figure files under paper/images. Prefer vector (PDF/SVG) for plots, high-DPI PNG for heatmaps/photos.
- In LaTeX, use: \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{paper/images/<name>}
- Captions: 1) what, 2) why it matters, 3) key takeaway. Avoid repeating axis labels.
- Label conventions: fig:*, tab:*, sec:*, eq:*. Example: \label{fig:ablations}
- Tables: report mean ± std when relevant; specify metric units; align decimals.
- Every figure/table must be referenced in the text and discussed (no orphaned artifacts).

# Equations & Notation
- Number all displayed equations: \begin{equation} ... \label{eq:...}\end{equation}
- Define symbols on first use; keep consistent typography (vectors bold, sets calligraphic, scalars plain).
- Units: SI with spaces (e.g., 20 dBm, 3 cm); percent with % sign.

# Code, Algorithms, and Reproducibility
- Pull variable names, algorithm steps, and pseudocode from paper/sample_code to ensure consistency.
- If listing code, prefer short, self-contained listings with language tags and captions.
- Provide enough implementation detail to reproduce: environment, key hyperparams, seed policy, hardware.
- If results come from scripts, mention exact script path and commit hash (if known).

# Lightweight Markup in paper/paper.txt
- Use these markers to guide conversion to LaTeX:
  - SECTION: <Title>
  - SUBSECTION: <Title>
  - FIG: <filename> | <caption> | <label>
  - TAB: <title/what> | <label> | <construction notes>
  - EQN: <math in LaTeX math mode> | <label> | <explanatory sentence>
  - CITE: <bibkey or short note if missing>
  - TODO: <task>
- Example:
  SECTION: Introduction
  Our work addresses ...
  CITE: smith2023transformers
  FIG: fig_pipeline.pdf | Overview of the proposed pipeline. | fig:pipeline

# Conversion to paper/paper.latex (expectations)
- Preserve section hierarchy and labels.
- Convert FIG/TAB/EQN blocks into proper LaTeX environments with \label and \caption.
- Translate inline math $...$ and display math $$...$$ safely to LaTeX math mode.
- Insert \index terms via a \keyword{} or “Index Terms” block as required by IEEE Access template.
- Do NOT introduce LaTeX packages that conflict with IEEE Access; keep the preamble minimal.

# Quality Bar (must pass before “Ready”)
[ ] Abstract states problem, method, numbers, and significance.
[ ] Contributions are bullet-listed, specific, and verifiable.
[ ] All claims backed by numbers (table/figure) or citations.
[ ] Each figure/table is referenced and interpreted in text.
[ ] Methods reproducible from description + sample_code pointers.
[ ] Limitations discussed candidly.
[ ] Index Terms present and appropriate.
[ ] References compile without errors; no missing bibkeys.
[ ] Spelling/grammar/style linted; no passive-voice overuse.
[ ] LaTeX compiles cleanly from paper/paper.latex (no broken refs).

# Editing Heuristics (what you should do automatically)
- Tighten wording: remove redundancies, nominalizations, and filler adverbs.
- Prefer “we propose/derive/show” only when followed by concrete content.
- Replace vague verbs (do, make, show) with precise verbs (estimate, optimize, demonstrate).
- Turn long paragraphs (>6 lines) into topic-sentence + support.
- Turn enumerations into concise bullet lists when appropriate (in txt; you’ll convert to LaTeX later).

# Tables/Figures From Results
- Never invent numbers. If numbers aren’t present, create a TODO with the exact metric and where to fetch it.
- If multiple similar figures exist under paper/images, suggest a unified naming scheme and update references.

# Baselines & Metrics (default expectations)
- State dataset splits, metrics (with definitions), and statistical treatment (mean ± std, n, CI if used).
- For fairness, list baselines, their sources/citations, and any tuning you applied.

# Limitations & Ethics
- Include a brief limitations paragraph acknowledging constraints, assumptions, and failure modes.
- If data involve privacy/sensitive content, state ethical safeguards and approvals (if applicable).

# Common Phrases to Avoid
- “To the best of our knowledge” (unless you’ve done a systematic search—then cite it).
- “Clearly,” “obviously,” “significantly” without numbers.
- “Revolutionary,” “breakthrough,” or any hype.

# Quick Commands (you can interpret these without further instructions)
- “Outline the paper”: Build a 1–2 page outline with section bullets and figure/table plan from paper/paper.txt.
- “Polish Methods”: Rewrite the Method section for clarity and completeness; align terminology with paper/sample_code.
- “Audit citations”: Insert/verify all required citations; produce a missing-bibkey TODO list.
- “Figure sweep”: Check paper/images for naming/duplication; propose standardized names and update references.
- “Tighten language”: Reduce length by 10–20% without losing meaning; flag any ambiguous claims.
- “Ablation plan”: Propose a minimal set of ablations that test each claimed contribution.
- “Latexify”: Convert current paper/paper.txt into paper/paper.latex with proper environments, labels, and figure/table includes.

# File & Label Conventions
- Figures: paper/images/fig_<shorttopic>_<nn>.pdf (or .png if raster)
- Tables: labels tab:<shorttopic>_<nn>
- Figures: labels fig:<shorttopic>_<nn>
- Equations: labels eq:<concept>_<nn>
- Sections: sec:<shorttitle>

# If Something Is Missing
- Never fabricate. Insert precise TODOs:
  TODO: Add F1@IoU=0.5 results for Dataset-X (val/test), from script paper/sample_code/exp/run_eval.py, seed 42.

# Done Definition
- paper/paper.txt is clean (no unresolved TODO/CITATION blocks unless explicitly deferred).
- paper/paper.latex compiles (no broken refs), includes all figures/tables, and adheres to IEEE Access conventions.
- All claims are evidenced or clearly marked as future work.
